<h2>Bear Behavior</h2>
<p><font size="+0">One of the things that makes Alaska so special is that <b>all three species</b> of North American bears flourish here.  There is a chance that you may be lucky enough to see a bear.  But even if you don't, you will never be far from one,
because <b>Alaska is bear country.</b></p>
<p>Brown/Grizzly bears are found from the islands of southeastern Alaska to the
arctic.  Black bears inhabit most of Alaska's forests.  Polar bears frequent the
pack ice and tundra of extreme northern and western Alaska.</p>
<p>Bears are curious, intelligent and potentially dangerous animals, but undue
fear of bears can endanger both bears and people.  Many bears are killed each
year by people who are afraid of them.  Respecting bears and learning proper
behavior in their territory will help so that if you encounter a bear, neither
of you will suffer needlessly from the experience. 
</p>
<p><b>Most bears tend to avoid people.</b>  In most cases, if you give a bear the
opportunity to do the right thing, it will.  Many bears live in Alaska and many
people enjoy the outdoors, but surprisingly few people even see bears.  Only a
tiny percentage of those few are ever threatened by a bear.  A study by the
state epidemiologist showed that during the first 85 years of this century, only
20 people died in bear attacks in Alaska.  In the 10 years 1975-85, 19 people in
Alaska were killed by dogs. 
</p>
<p>Female bears can be fierce defenders of their young.  Getting between a
female and her cubs is a <b>serious mistake</b>.  A female bear may respond
aggressively to any threat she perceives to her cubs. 
</p>
<p>Most people who see a bear in the wild consider it the highlight of their
trip.  The presence of these majestic creatures is a reminder of how privileged
we are to share some of the country's dwindling wilderness.

<h2><a NAME="BEARS">Bears</a> and People</h2>
<p><b><i>Bears Don't Like Surprises!  </i></b>    If you are hiking through
bear country, make your presence known-especially where the terrain or
vegetation makes it hard to see.  Make noise, sing, talk loudly or tie a bell to
your pack.  If possible, travel with a group.  Groups are noisier and easier for
bears to detect.  Avoid thick brush.  If you can't, try to walk with the wind at
your back so your scent will warn bears of your presence.  Contrary to popular
belief, bears can see almost as well as people, but trust their noses much more
than their eyes or ears.  Always let bears know you are there.</p>
<p><b><i>Don't Crowd Bears!  </i></b>    Give bears plenty of room.  Some
bears are more tolerant than others, but every bear has  a &quot;personal space&quot;-
the distance within which a bear feels threatened. If you stray within that
zone, a bear may react aggressively.  When photographing bears, use long lenses;
getting close for a great shot could put your inside the danger zone. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Bears Are Always Looking for Something to Eat!  </i></b>    Bears
have only about six months to build up fat reserves for their long winter
hibernation.  Don't let them learn human food or garbage is an easy meal.  It is
both foolish and illegal to feed bears, either on purpose or by leaving food or
garbage that attracts them. 
</p>
<p><b>Cook away from your tent.</b>  Store all food away from your campsite.  Hang
food out of reach of bears if possible.  If no trees are available, store your
food in airtight or specially designed bear-proof containers.  Remember, pets
and their food may also attract bears. 
</p>
<p><b>Keep a clean camp.</b>  Wash your dishes.  Avoid smelly food like bacon and
smoked fish.  Keep food smells off your clothing.  Burn garbage completely in a
hot fire and pack out the remains.  Food and garbage are equally attractive to a
bear so treat them with equal care.  Burying garbage is a waste of time.  Bears
have keen noses and are great diggers. 
</p>
<p>If a bear approaches while you are fishing, stop fishing.  If you have a
fish on your line, don't let it splash.  If that's not possible, cut your line. 
If a bear learns it can obtain fish just by approaching fishermen, it will
return for more.</font size="+0">

<h2><a NAME="CLOSE">Close</a> Encounters: What to do</h2>
<p><font size="+0"><b>If you see a bear, avoid it if you can.</b>  Give the bear every opportunity to
avoid you.  If you do encounter a bear at close distance, remain calm.  <b>Attacks
are rare.</b>  Chances are, you are not in danger.  Most bears are interested only
in protecting food, cubs or their &quot;personal space.&quot;  Once the threat
is removed, they will move on.  Remember the following: 
</p>
<p><b>Identify Yourself</b>  Let the bear know you are human.  Talk to the
bear in a normal voice.  Wave your arms.  Help the bear recognize your.  If a
bear cannot tell what your are, it may come closer or stand on its hind legs to
get a better look or smell.  A standing bear is usually curious, not
threatening.  You may try to back away slowly diagonally, but it the bear
follows, stop and hold your ground. 
</p>
<p><b>Don't Run</b>  You can't outrun a bear.  They have been clocked at
speeds up to 35 mph, and like dogs, they will chase fleeing animals.  Bears
often make bluff charges, sometimes to within 10 feet of their adversary,
without making contact.  Continue waving your arms and talking to the bear.  If
the bear gets too close, raise your voice and be more aggressive.  Band pots and
pans.  Use noisemakers.  Never imitate bear sounds or make a high-pitched
squeal. 
</p>
<p><b>Surrender</b>  If a brown bear actually touches you, fall to the ground
and play dead.  Lie flat on your stomach, or curl up in a ball with your hands
behind your neck.  Typically a brown bear will break off its attack once it
feels the threat has been eliminated.  Remain motionless for as long as
possible.  If you move, a brown bear may return and renew its attack and you
must again play dead.  If you are attacked by a black bear, fight back
vigorously.</font size="+0">

<h2><a NAME="PROTECTION">Protection</a></h2>
<p><font size="+0">Firearms should never be used as an alternative to common-sense approaches to bear encounters.  If you are inexperienced with a firearm in emergency
situations, you are more likely to be injured by a gun than a bear.  It is illegal to carry firearms in some of Alaska's national parks, so check before you go. 
</p>
<p>A .300-Magnum rifle or a 12-gauge shotgun with rifled slugs are appropriate
weapons if you have to shoot a bear.  Heavy handguns such as a .44-Magnum may be
inadequate in emergency situations, especially in untrained hands. 
</p>
<p>State law allows a bear to be shot in self-defense if you did not provoke
the attack and if there is no alternative, but the hide and skull must be
salvaged and turned over to the authorities. 
</p>
<p>Defensive aerosol sprays which contain capsicum (red pepper extract) have
been used with some success for protection against bears.  These sprays may be
effective at a range of 6-8 yards.  If discharged upwind or in a vehicle, they
can disable the user.  Take appropriate precautions.  If you carry a spray can,
keep it handy and know how to use it.

<h2><a NAME="IN">In</a> Summary</h2>
<p>* Avoid surprising bears at close distance; look for signs of bears and make
plenty of noise.
<br>* Avoid crowding bears; respect their &quot;personal space.&quot;
<br>* Avoid attracting bears through improper handling of food or garbage.
<br>* Plan ahead, stay calm, identify yourself, don't run. 
</p>
<p>In most cases, bears are not a threat, but they do deserve your respect and
attention.  When traveling in bear country, keep alert and enjoy the opportunity
to see these magnificent animals in their natural habitat.
