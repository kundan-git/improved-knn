        and other public service people. Some common areas where bears like to frequent are:
        avalanche chutes, stream beds, dense edge cover and, in late summer, berry patches.</font></p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="arial,helvetica" COLOR="#000000" size="2">&#149; Use
        extreme caution when travelling on trails at night or at either end of day.</font></p>
        <font size="2"><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="arial,helvetica">&#149; Be careful with food
        smells - never cook close to camp. Store all foods in plastic away from camp at night and
        when camp is unattended. We suggest at least 100 yards from camp and at least 14 feet up a
        tree hung 4 feet away from the trunk.</font></p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="arial,helvetica">&#149; Watch for fresh <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B> sign (scat or

        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="arial,helvetica">&#149; If possible, make plenty of noise
        on the trail, especially on blind curves, in dense vegetation or areas with limited
        vision.</font></p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="arial,helvetica">&#149; Be conscious of the wind - bears
        have an excellent sense of smell. If the wind is at your back, chances are a <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B> will
        smell you and leave the area well before you reach it. If the wind is blowing in your
        face, your chances of an encounter greatly increase. Also, in high wind situations or
        along creeks and streams, a <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B> might not hear you coming or<em> </em>you might not hear<em>
        </em>it.</font></p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="arial,helvetica">&#149; Dead animal carcass - If you come
        upon a dead animal carcass, immediately leave the area. Bears will often feed on a carcass
        for days and also stay in the area to protect their food.</font></p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="arial,helvetica">&#149; <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">Bear</B> cubs - If you see a <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B> cub,

    and you can reduce your chances of an encounter. If you can&#146;t avoid these areas, be
    extra cautious and alert when travelling through them. Bears like to travel on saddles,
    ridges, game trails and along water. They&#146;ll eat dead animal carcasses wherever they
    can find them. They feed on green grasses and also vegetation that grows in wet areas.
    They often rest in cool, dark, thick forests. Grizzly bears are typically, but not
    exclusively active during the dawn, dusk, and nighttime hours.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="arial,helvetica">In spring and early summer, bears are
    often found in lower elevations along rivers and streams. They love to catch fish when the
    spawning runs are going. They will also search for winter killed animals in these areas.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="arial,helvetica">In the summer, bears usually spend time at
    higher elevations, often in park like areas. They&#146;ll eat wild berries when they are
    ripe. If you like to go out wild berry picking, be extra careful, make lots of noise and
    keep children near you at all times.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="arial,helvetica">In the fall, bears are often found in
    whitebark pine stands eating pine nuts. Sometimes a <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B> will dig around a tree to try to
    locate a squirrels cache of nuts. Bears also dig for roots in mid-elevation meadows,
    especially in years when there are fewer pine nuts. </font></font></td>

    <font size="2"><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="arial,helvetica">Bears seem to experience
    moods much like we do; they can be shy, curious, pushy, or aggressive, and can possess
    other attributes that we can identify as humanlike. Each time you get close to a <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B>, you
    encounter a specific individual that </font><font face="arial,helvetica" COLOR="#000000">may
    behave differently from any other individual you have ever met before or will ever meet
    again.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="arial,helvetica">Grizzly <B style="color:black;background-color:#99ff99">attack</B> victims are often not aware
    of why they were attacked. Many attacks are caused by close encounters, where the <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B> has
    been surprised and feels threatened by human presence. A female with cubs will be
    especially aggressive and will defend her cubs from any possible threat. Many attacks can
    be avoided if the <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B> sees a way out of the situation.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="arial,helvetica">Bears are basically solitary animals. Each
    has its zone of danger, or personal space, which varies from animal to animal. If
    something or someone penetrates this zone, a response in the form of a bluff charge,
    bodily contact, or outright <B style="color:black;background-color:#99ff99">attack</B> may result. Often times grizzly bears will essentially
    ignore people until a person enters enters into a bear's &quot;personal space&quot;. Even
    groups as large as 100 people have been ignored by grizzly bears until one of the group
    gets too close. Most bears are timid enough to flee a possible encounter if they sense the
    presence of something or someone soon enough to leave the area undetected. On the other
    hand, when a <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B> is surprised, the <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B> may see you as a threat, forcing an immediate
    response. </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial,helvetica">A person who runs when frightened by a <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B> may trigger a
    chase response. One <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B> will even chase another if it runs. Bears that stand their ground
    when confronted by other bears usually aren&#146;t attacked, and bears that behave
    submissively have a lower incidence of being attacked as well. A grizzly <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B> rarely wants
    to kill a human. Considering the damage a grizzly is capable of inflicting on a human,
    wounds resulting from <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B> attacks are often nothing more than superficial bites, scrapes,
    and lacerations. The evidence is very clear that grizzlies do no t try to kill a human as
    a result of a close encounter, they simply try to remove a perceived threat. The injuries
    that occur are more a function of what the human does to resist, rather than what the <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B>
    is capable of doing. Of course, a grizzly entering a tent represents a predatory event
    which is behaviorally very different than a close encounter situation.</font></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="arial,helvetica" COLOR="#000000" size="2">Young grizzlies
    can pose another danger. Often these bears have just left their mother and rank low on the
    hierarchical scale. Larger, more dominant bears often push these juveniles into marginal
    habitat. To survive, young bears do alot of exploring. If these bears start using
    campgrounds as foraging areas, they may quickly become dangerous to people camping in
    them. In extremely rare instances, young grizzlies will even key onto people as potential
    prey.</font></p>
    <font size="2"><p><font face="arial,helvetica"><B style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">Black</B> bears seem to rely more on sheer
    bluffing than on charging and mauling. Those rare instances in which a <B style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">black </B><B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B> presses
    an <B style="color:black;background-color:#99ff99">attack</B> can probably be grouped into two categories: First, a female protecting her
    cubs, particularly if she is also habituated and food-conditioned; or second, a <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B> that
    has no experience with humans and may regard them as possible prey.</font></font></p>

        HUNTING IN GRIZZLY COUNTRY?</font></p>
        </b><font size="2"><p><font face="arial,helvetica">Sportsmen, who harvest big game animals
        in grizzly country, should be aware that the sound of a gun shot might sound like a dinner
        bell to a wandering grizzly. Some hunters, tracking down their &quot;trophy elk&quot;, can
        be quite surprised when they find a grizzly has beat them to it. Hunters who make a kill
        in grizzly country should make lots of noise as they carefully approach the carcass. They
        should also try to view the carcass from a distance to see if a grizzly is guarding it.
        The blood and gore at a kill site may attract a keen-nosed, opportunistic grizzly.</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="2">Many hunters who have killed animals and returned
        the next morning to pack out the meat, have been suddenly confronted by an aggressive <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B>
        who had claimed the kill overnight. If a kill site appears disturbed, but no <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B> is seen,
        it&#146;s best to back off because the <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B> may be lying in cover nearby. A <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B> on a kill
        may refuse to back off, even when shots are fired into the ground nearby, and many
        sportsmen have been forced to relinquish their harvested game animal to a protective <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B>
        guarding its food supply. Smart sportsmen who harvest big game animals in grizzly country
        try to pack out the meat the same day of the kill, or they carry the quartered carcass to
        a safe spot a few hundred yards from the bloody kill site and then hang the quarters high
        in a tree.
