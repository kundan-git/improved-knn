<p align="center"></font><em><font color="#000080" size="6"><b>Tuberculosis</b></font></em></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>Tuberculosis</em> (TB) is a chronic, often a
lifelong process, as well as infectious, and contagious disease, caused by a
specific bacteria: <em>Koch's bacillus.</em> There are two species of bacillus
capable of producing infection in humans: <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> (M.T)
and <em>Mycobacterium bovis</em> (M. bovis).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">M. bovis infection was recognized as a major public
health problem when this organism was transmitted to humans via the milk from
infected cows. The introduction of the pasteurization of milk helped to control
this problem. However, M. T. infection is still, world wide, a serious public
health problem, especially in developing countries.<br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<strong><font size="4">Statistical survey.</font></strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 20
million new TB cases are reported annually. TB is also responsible for 3 million
deaths every year, more than any other infectious disease. Also, WHO estimates
that one-third of the world's population is infected with this disease.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In Canada, the number of TB cases declined sharply
after the introduction of specific drugs for TB treatment in the 1950's. To
date, the number of new cases is approximately 2,000 per year. In 1995, a total
of 22,813 new cases of TB were reported in the United States.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In Waterloo Region, between 1990 and 1994, the TB rate
has remained less than 6 people per 100,000 habitants per year. TB affects both
sexes, males accounting for 58% of the total cases. Young adults were affected
the most, especially between 15 to 35 years old, and older than age 65. Four
cases of TB were diagnosed in children under the age of 5.<br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</font><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">Who is at high-risk?</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#000080">At present, TB remains concentrated in certain
high-risk groups:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">1- People born in areas where the disease is present
all the time, such as Asia, Africa, Middle East, eastern and southern Europe,
Latin America and the Caribbean. 2- Aboriginal communities. 3- HIV-infected
people. 4- Homeless or urban poor individuals. 5- Those with inactive TB that
has not been adequately treated. 6- Intravenous drug users. 7- Malnutrition
and/or alcoholism. 8- People with diabetes, and 9- People with certain types of
cancer.</font></p>
<p><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">How do you acquire TB?</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#000080">It is important differentiate between TB infection and
TB disease. When someone gets the bacillus in the body, and has not yet
developed symptoms of disease, however, a special skin test -<em>Mantoux</em>-
is positive, this person has <u><strong>TB infection,</strong></u> also named <em>&quot;inactive
TB&quot;</em>, or TB exposure. When a person gets the bacillus in the body, has
symptoms from TB, and the laboratory tests confirm the presence of bacillus
which causes TB, this person has <u><strong>TB disease</strong></u> or <em>&quot;active
TB&quot;.</em> Only the person with active TB can spread TB bacillus to others.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><strong>To acquire TB</strong> you have to be in
contact with someone who has active TB. When a person with active TB coughs,
sneezes, signs, or speaks, they release the TB bacteria, millions of them into
the surrounding air. If you continuously breathe this contaminated air with the
TB bacillus, you can acquire TB, however, it is rarely acquired by sharing
drinks or food with an active TB patient. <strong>The common contagious form is
via air.</strong><br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<strong><font size="4">What happens after contagion?</font></strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The bacillus reaches the lungs, that is the common
first place attacked, developing <em>pulmonary TB</em>. From here, the bacillus
can go and attack another parts of the body such as bones and joints, especially
the spine; the liver, brain, reproductive, urinary and digestive systems, etc..</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In some cases, the body can fight off the infection and
surrounds the bacillus in little capsules called <em>tubercles</em>, in which
the TB bacillus are harmless -like <u>&quot;sleeping&quot;</u> germs-. An
important thing to keep in mind is that sometimes you can develop TB disease
several years, usually within 2-3 years, after being exposed for the first time.
This commonly happens as a result of not eating well, poor living conditions,
excess stress, acquiring AIDS or other medical problems, or growing older.<br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</font><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">What are the pulmonary TB
symptoms?</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Early diagnosis is very important in the control and
cure of TB. The symptoms are:</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font color="#000080">A lot of coughing , and chest pain while coughing.
    The cough is &quot;dry&quot; at beginning of the disease, maybe for several
    months, then</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Coughing up mucus, blood, or a mixture of both.
    Sometimes, coughing up blood is the first manifestation of TB disease.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Fever: In some cases a chronic low-grade fever is
    the only symptom of TB and, in this particularly case, the diagnosis is does
    not easy.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Others symptoms of pulmonary TB are night sweats,
    loss of appetite, loss of weight, easy fatigue or feeling very tired.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">What test do you do for TB?</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#000080">A special skin test:<em> <u>Mantoux</u>.</em> It
consists of an almost painless injection of a small amount of a special liquid
in the skin of your forearm. Later, 48 to 72 hours, the doctor or nurse will
check and measure the spot to see if there is any swelling. Only those reactions
over a certain size are considered positive. The Mantoux test becomes positive 3
to 12 weeks after TB contagion. Up-dated studies show that <em>Monotest</em>,
another TB skin test for screening TB infection, was recently introduced with
successful results, and maybe a useful alternative.</font></p>
<p><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">What does a positive skin test mean?</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#000080">It means that you have been exposed to TB bacteria, and
you have them in your body. It does not mean that you have active disease.
However, your doctor will send you for a <u>chest x-ray</u> to see if the TB
germs have damaged your lungs. To diagnose active TB disease, TB bacillus have
to be present in the spit (sputum) or other clinical specimens.<br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</font><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">What about TB treatment?</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Do you remember the differences between TB inactive and
TB active described above?, well, the TB treatment depends on these facts: <strong>Chemoprophylaxis</strong>
or<strong> </strong>&quot;preventive&quot; treatment: It is indicated in
patients with TB inactive. The medicine usually prescribed is <em>Isoniazid</em>
(INH), it stops the bacteria from developing active TB, &quot;preventing&quot;
future body damage by TB bacteria. INH is usually taken once a day for 6 to 12 <strong>continuous</strong>
months. <strong>Treatment of active TB disease: </strong>If you do not take
preventive treatment at all, or if you do not take it as prescribed, the TB
bacillus may <u>&quot;wake up&quot;</u>, attack the body and develop an active
TB. Usually, 2-3 weeks of isolation measures will be instituted until you are
not longer contagious, as well as the combination of 2 or 3 medicaments: <em>Isonazid,
Rifampin</em> and/or <em>Pyrazinamid</em>. In some cases, the TB treatment is
with 4 drugs: the three named above plus <em>Ethambutol </em>or <em>Streptomycin</em>.<br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</font><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">Can TB disease be cured?</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Yes!. But you <strong>most</strong> take all your
medicines until your doctor tells you to stop. Usually the treatment is for 9 or
12 months, however, it can be much longer. If you stop taking your TB medicines,
if you keep forgetting to take them, or you only take one of them, the TB
bacteria might become resistant to the drugs and you might never be cured.</font></p>
<p><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">What about TB vaccine?</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The vaccine for TB, or <em>BCG</em> (Bacillus of
Calmette-Guerin), has been limited in its use in children to prevent, with high
efficacy (&gt;80%), the serious forms of TB. BCG is not recommended for children
and adults who are HIV-infected. To date, a new vaccine against TB is under
study.<br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</font><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">Some important points to remember.</font></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><font color="#000080">Prevention is better than cure.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">TB still exists in a lot of countries, including
    Canada.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Several test are required to determine if the TB
    bacillus are present in your body, and if the TB is active or not, for
    example: skin test, chest x-ray and sputum test.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">You may need a TB skin test for employment, travel,
    or because you have been in contact with a person who has active TB.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Keep in mind that sometimes you can develop TB
    disease several years after you were first exposed.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">If you are HIV-infected, it is very important to be
    tested for TB infection at least once a year.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">If you take your treatment <strong>as prescribed</strong>
    you will most likely be cured within a year.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Keep taking the treatment even if you are feeling
    better. <strong>Do not stop it!</strong></font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">The only important cause of treatment failure is
    non-compliance.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">TB treatment is absolutely free.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080"><u>You have to cover your mouth and your nose</u>
    while you are coughing or sneezing!!</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#000080">If you want to know more about TB, treatment of TB,
etc., feel free to call your doctor, nurse, local health unit, or Health
Department.</font><br wp="br1">
