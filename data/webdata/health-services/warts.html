<font color="red" size="+3">
<p align="center"></font><em><b><font color="#000080" size="6">Warts</font></b></em></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Along skin, dermis forms bump-like or &quot;&quot;papillas&quot;
projecting them to epidermis like pillars supporting a building. Warts are
produced by the virus, <strong>Human Papilloma Virus </strong>(HPV), that causes
in the papilla abnormal growth outward (<em>papillomas). </em>There are over 60
different HPV types, and they can affect the skin anywhere, as well as tissues
covering cavities and some surfaces such as nose, mouth, anus, penis, and
vagina.</font></p>
<p><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">How do you get warts?</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#000080">HPV infection is a <strong>sexually transmitted disease
</strong>(STD) associated, especially, with <em>cervix</em> changes and cancer.
Warts are both, the viral infection on the genitals and the STD most common
among adolescents, followed by the Chlamydial infection, Gonorrhea, and
Trichomonas. However, the contagion is not only a STD. You may get warts by
contact of your hands, or other parts of your body , with warts who somebody
has; by sharing shoes or socks with someone who has warts on the soles of their
feet; or in a public shower. If you have warts, you can spread them yourself on
other part of your body, by scratching your warts and then scratching your skin
somewhere else (auto-inoculation). The same thing is for the hand-finger-mouth,
and hand-anus-genitals routes. HPV affects males and females, at any age group.
Warts have devastating psychological effects in some people. New warts cases are
increasing every day.</font></p>
<p><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">What about symptoms?</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The diagnosis is usually straight forward. Most of the
time there are no symptoms. However, tenderness or pain upon pressure occurs
with plantar warts; itching, with anal or genital warts; and nail warts are
quite painful. Occasionally, warts may produce mechanical obstruction when they
are located in the nose, ear canal, larynx, urinary canal.</font></p>
<p><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">Types of warts.</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Warts vary widely in shape, size, appearance, and there
are different types of warts:</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font color="#000080"><strong>Common warts. </strong>The most common HPV
    infection. They are hard papillomas with dry and rough surface, skin color
    and round shape, and can be an isolated lesion or formed in groups. Sites of
    predilection: hands, fingers, knees (traumas sites).</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080"><strong>Plane warts. </strong>These small warts are
    flat and located on face or hands. Skin colored or light brown; round, oval,
    or polygonal shape; always numerous and forming close set.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080"><strong>Plantar warts. </strong>On the plantar and
    palmar surfaces, warts tend not to grow outward but instead downward. They
    are most common in female adolescents, especially public locker room users,
    and, with higher risk, public shower users. Athletes are often affected.
    These kind of warts are frequently mistaken for calluses.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080"><strong>Nail warts. </strong>They have same shape as
    common warts, and can grow sub-ungual or peri-ungual. Nail warts may destroy
    the nail and they are difficult to treat.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080"><strong>Oral warts. </strong>HPV causes a variety of
    papillomas in the oral mucous tissues and even in the larynx. They have in
    general a velvet-like shape and white color.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080"><strong>Genital warts. </strong>Including perianal
    warts, they are the most outstanding of all warts types, not only because
    their easy sexual transmission, but their potential transformation in
    cancer, especially in women. It is alarming that <strong>93% </strong>of
    cervical cancer cases are associated with the presence of warts, and 25% or
    more of abnormal Papanicolaou smears have a similar association. In women,
    HPV genital infection may causes sterility and infertility. Genital warts
    are transmitted to newborn via passage along the contaminated genital area.
    The child may get complications early or later in life. A number of children
    with laryngeal papillomas have developed cancer of the larynx.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font color="#000080">Genital warts, also named condylomas, are soft, skin
colored, pink or red, pin-head warts or fleshy warts in cauliflower-like masses.
They flourish on moist semi-destroyed surface, smelling bad, or on dry surfaces.
Usually in clusters, genital warts are <strong>highly contagious, </strong>sexual
and non-sexual transmitted. Warts can appear 4-6 wee after contagion, or in a
few days, as well as soon after the intercourse. It take months to grow and
affect anywhere on the genital and/or anus areas. Perianal warts are more common
in homosexual/bisexual men, and the lesions become worse in patients with AIDS.<br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</font><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">What about malignant
transformation?</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The long term consequences of HPV infection are more
serious in females than males. Malignant transformation is caused by some types
of HPV, especially in vulva, vagina and cervix areas. The association of
Chlamydia and HPV is a predisposing factor in cervico-uterine cancer. Smoking is
other cofactor in the development of cervical cancer: some studies confirm this
theory by founding significant levels of nicotine in cervical mucus. Malignant
conversion of perianal warts may occur in some cases, as well as from nail warts
or from plantar warts. Papillomas in the mouth , and in the larynx may become
cancer. HPV is associated with development of skin cancer in HIV infected
people.</font></p>
<p><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">Treatment.</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Although more than 50% of warts resolve spontaneously
within 2 years, often after suggestion, many, <strong>if untreated, </strong>may
spread and cause considerable discomfort, and cancer risk. On <em>skin warts</em>
the treatments are:</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font color="#000080"><strong>Cryotherapy</strong>: warts are freezing
    with liquid nitrogen.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080"><strong>Electrocautery</strong>: after local
    anesthetization the wart is burned followed for surgical scrape.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080"><strong>Keratolytic agents</strong>: used to peel
    off the wart tissue, such as salicylic acid and lactic acid. On plantar
    warts, salicylic acid is used in high concentration -40%-, and the
    electrocautery or surgery is avoided because the lesion may grows again with
    painful scar.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080"><strong>Pulsed dye laser</strong> is a highly
    effective and safe method, without damaging the surrounding skin, used to
    destroy rebellious warts, this mean, these warts that failed to respond to
    keratolytic or destructive treatment. Flat warts are the most responsive to
    dye laser treatment.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080"><strong>Immunotherapy</strong> with
    Dinitro-chloro-benzene (DNCB) is useful in resistant, and/or numerous warts.
    DNCB produces a boost of warts antibodies.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080"><strong>Tretinoin,</strong> commonly used for acne
    treatment, seems to be effective for facial or bread warts.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font color="#000080">The different forms of <strong>treatment </strong>for <em>genital
warts </em>remains frustrating due at high recurrence rate associated with all
modalities, particularly in women if vaginal discharge is present. The treatment
should be multiple: cryotherapy, laser, surgery, immunotherapy, etc. <strong>Podophyllin
</strong>(25%) and its newer form Podofilox, is commonly used on anogenital
warts with excellent results. It is applied at weekly intervals and allowed to
dry 4-6 hours before being washed off. Podophyllin and Podofilox are not used
during pregnancy, and they have very bad response, due to its high recurrence
(67%), on skin warts. <strong>Immunotherapy </strong>treatment with interferon
represent a promising new treatment, especially on resistant and extensive
warts. With this method the recurrence rate is very low. Recently, <strong>5-Fluoracille
</strong>cream, utilized locally as prophylactic, after cleared the lesions,
seems to give excellent results. Other new medicament to treat anogenital warts
is <strong>Imiquimod </strong>cream, topical during 16 weeks, seems to be
successful too.</font></p>
<p><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">Prevention.</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Even once the lesion(s) has been fully cleared, there
remains a small but real risk of HPV transmission to a partner. There is no
anti-wart vaccine. <strong>High risk factors for</strong> HPV are the same for
any STD and AIDS:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font color="#000080">Early age at first sex.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Age 15-25 and sexually active.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Alcohol and drug users.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Prostitution.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Homosexual/bisexual men.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Previous history of STD.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">More than 3 sexual partners in the last year.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Recent change of sexual partner</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Unprotected sex with a bisexual man.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Unprotected anal sex.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Pregnant adolescent.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">High levels of psychosocial problems.</font></li>
</ul>
<font color="#000080"><strong>Healthy prevention, </strong>or healthy sex habits
means: adopting <strong>responsible </strong>behavior, looking at issues of
self-esteem, delaying sex, negotiating latex condom use with a new partner,
learning to <em>&quot;just say no&quot;.</em></font>
<p><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">Some points to remember.</font></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><font color="#000080">Avoid contact with warts, do not scratch them.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Wear your own sleepers in a public locker room or in
    a public shower.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">If you have hand, finger or nail warts, do not bite
    your nails.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">If you participate in athletic activities, protect
    your hands by wearing weight-lifter gloves.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Women with genital warts or who have a partner with
    genital warts, keep to a regular schedule of Pap. screaming.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">HPV infection increase the risk of genital cancer,
    especially cervix-uterus cancer.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">When warts are visible, using a latex condom will
    prevent transmission, but it won't protect all areas. What do you think
    happens to the contagion when genital warts are located in non-visible
    areas??.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Sexual partner(s) should also be evaluated and
    treated to break down the infection link.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Cigarettes smoking may delays successful results
    from treatment.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Be aware of high risk sexual transmitter disease
    partners.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#000080"><b><i>Self-esteem and responsible behavior are the keys
for STD and AIDS prevention.</i></b></font><br>
