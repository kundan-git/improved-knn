<p align="center"></font><em><font size="6" color="#000080"><b>Chicken Pox &amp;
Shingles</b></font></em></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Chickenpox, also named <em>Varicella,</em> is a viral
disease acquired via the air when someone inhales the infected droplets released
by the ill person, or through direct contact with the lesions. It affects both
sexes. Although most cases occur in children, chickenpox may occur in adulthood
or elderly people.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">One attack confers permanent immunity, in other words,
if you had chickenpox, you will never get chickenpox again. However, this fact
is excepted in children infected with HIV; in these cases, chickenpox and
shingles, becomes a chronic disease and/or a repeating disease.<br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<font size="4"><b>What are chickenpox symptoms?</b></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The first manifestations of disease begin between 10 to
20 days after contagious. This is the period of incubation, this is the time
that the virus needs, to grow and spread in the body before manifestations of
the disease appear. After the period of incubation, there are, during 1 or 2
days, general symptoms such as high-grade fever ( 39 C or 40 C ); malaise, with
loss of appetite, and headaches. At the same time, the first lesions of
chickenpox are present in the mouth. Then, on the skin, appears the rash, that
is more prominent on the face, scalp and trunk. Characteristically, the lesions
of chickenpox on the skin begin on the trunk, and from here, the lesions spread
to other skin surfaces including extremities.<br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<font size="4"><b>How chickenpox lesions change?</b></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The evolution of the chickenpox lesion is through
different stages: initially the rash, that itches a lot, is characterized by
small red spots with rapid change to bumps. This union of spot-bump, changes in
a few hours to a small blister. The liquid contained in the blister, initially
is clear, however, quickly becomes blurry, and it is highly contagious because
it contains the virus that is producing the disease. While the blurry blister
begins to dry, sometimes by itself, in the center, it forms a dark and
depressing point, until the blurry blister becomes totally dry, and then forms
the crust. Otherwise, the blurry blister ruptures and the liquid dries, also
forming a crust. After the crust falls off, it leaves a small ulcer. If the
ulcer is deep, or a secondary infection by a bacteria occurs, it will form a
scar.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">New lesions may appear during the next five days, so
all the eruption stages are generally present simultaneously. The crusts usually
sloughs off in 7 to 14 days. The total duration from onset of symptoms to
disappearance of crusts rarely exceeds 2 weeks.<br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<font size="4"><b>Laboratory:</b></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Some tests are specialized to identify the virus,
however, a white cell count below the normal number in a single blood-work, is
enough information.<br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<font size="4"><b>And, what about shingles?</b></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Shingles, also named <em>Herpes Zoster,</em> is a
disease caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox in persons who have
experienced chickenpox before. Usually, a <u>single</u> and <u>unilateral zone</u>
is involved. The trunk is the most involved area, however, shingles can affect
the face, especially the ophthalmic zone, or any other part of the body. Pain,
sometimes very severe, or a feeling of burning skin, may precede the appearance
of the skin lesions. These lesions that <u>follow</u> the distribution of a
nerve, are similar to chickenpox lesions, and also have the same evolution.
Complete resolution of the lesions may take 2 to 6 weeks. The post-shingles
pain, in the affected area, may last 6 months, especially in elderly people.
Usually, shingles disease does not repeat. Shingles and chicken pox have the
same treatment (see below).<br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<font size="4"><b>Does chickenpox have complications?</b></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Yes. 1- Secondary bacterial infection of the lesions is
common and can lead to pitted scars. 2- Also, a deep infection in the skin may
occur. 3- Up-dated studies show that individuals with chickenpox have a high
risk of acquiring <em>Flesh-eating disease:</em> an invasive and aggressive
bacterial disease with high mortality rate. 4- Pneumonia, is another
complication, more often in adults, it can lead to severe difficulty in
breathing, and some times death. 5- Infection in the brain is another grave
complication. 6- In immunosuppressed people, for example, individuals with AIDS,
cancer, after organ transplant, etc. chickenpox and shingles, can spread
throughout the body, becoming a serious, persistent, recurrent, and fatal
infection.<br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<b><font size="4">Prevention:</font></b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Varicella-Zoster immune globulin (VZIG), a medication
used to produce a boost in the immune system of the body, is effective in
preventing chickenpox in exposed immunosuppressed individuals, however, VZIG is
not useful in the treatment against the disease. In general, to prevent
chickenpox and shingles, you have to avoid contact with people developing these
diseases.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Something new in the medical field, is the <strong>chickenpox
vaccine</strong>. Live attenuated varicella vaccine was licensed in the United
States in March 1995 after 15 years of clinical testing. The indications
approved by the FDA (Federal Drugs Administration - USA -) include healthy
children of one year of age or older, and adults, if both, children and adults,
do not have a history of chickenpox. Children with leukemia can not have the
vaccine. It is virtually 100% effective in preventing the severe forms of
disease often seen in adults. To date, the chickenpox vaccine is not yet
available in Canada.<br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<b><font size="4">What about chickenpox or shingles during pregnancy ?</font></b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Chickenpox rarely occurs during pregnancy. However,
affected patients risk not only grave complications such as varicella pneumonia,
but also fetal contamination with potentially malformative effects, or severe
infection in the newborn, depending on whether the infection occurs, early or
late during the pregnancy.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">For the mother, respiratory distress is the main risk,
with mortality reaching nearly 20%. The maternal chickenpox disease seems to be
worse in the latter half of pregnancy. For the baby, born underweight, premature
delivery and fetal malformations are observed when the fetal infection occurs
early, this means, before the end of the fifth month of pregnancy. The
manifestation of fetal varicella usually involves several organ systems, such
as, skin, ocular (68%), neurologic, digestive, and genito-urinary.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Unlike chickenpox, there is apparently little or no
risk either for the mother or for the child in the case of shingles during
pregnancy.<br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<b><font size="4">Treatment:</font></b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">I.- General measures. Isolation, of the ill person, is
recommended until the crusts have disappeared, and bed rest until the fever is
gone. Keep the skin clean by means of tub baths or showers except during a
fever. Calamine lotion externally may help to attenuate the itch. Your doctor
may also indicate an anti-histamine (medication used for allergies), also for
relief of itching, and acetaminophen for relief of fever. <em>Aspirin</em> and <em>ibuprofen</em>
should be <strong>avoided.</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">II.-Treatment of complications. Topical antibiotic is
indicated if a local and secondary bacterial infection is present. An oral
antibiotic is prescribed, if the lesions infected are extensive. Antiviral
treatment, with a high-dose of <em>acyclovir,</em> should be started early
-within 48 hours from onset of eruption- for chickenpox or shingles in
immunosuppressed patients, also in the case of ophthalmic shingles, or grave
complications. Acyclovir seems to be safe and well tolerated during pregnancy.<br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
<b><font size="4">Some points to remember:</font></b></font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font color="#000080">In order to be safe, avoid contact or approaching
    someone with chickenpox or shingles, especially if you are a pregnant woman.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Do not share food and drinks with somebody who has
    the disease.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">If you get chickenpox or shingles do not scratch the
    lesions, you have to avoid sun exposure, and avoid spicy and/or hot (chili)
    foods.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Cover your nose and mouth while you are sneezing or
    coughing.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">If you have had chickenpox, you will never get it
    again.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">One or two tub baths a day with oats will be helpful
    for moisturizing the skin and itch control. There are available,
    over-the-counter, medicated oat preparations.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">If you want to know more about chickenpox or
    shingles feel free to call your doctor, nurse, or your Health Department.<br wp="br1">
    </font></li>
