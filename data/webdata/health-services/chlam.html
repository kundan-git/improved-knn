<p align="center"></font><em><font size="6" color="#000080"><b>Chlamydial
Infections</b></font></em></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><strong>Chlamydial infections </strong>(CI) are the
most prevalent of all sexually transmitted diseases (STD) in North America,
producing infections 2 to 3 times more in people than gonorrhea. CI is caused by
the micro-organism <em>Chlamydia trachomatis </em>(CT), that causes many
different human infections involving genital region, urinary tract, eye, and
respiratory tract. Particularly frequent in sexually active adolescents, the
incidence rate of CI, in Canada, is estimated to be 216 per 100,000 people per
year. Among sexual partners the rate of CI is about 70%. CI affects both sexes,
however, females are affected the most and get the worse complications, at short
or long term.</font></p>
<p><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">How do you acquire CI?</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#000080">By direct contact, usually sexual with an infected
person. If you get CI you can infect your sex partner(s).</font></p>
<p><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">Who is at high-risk?</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#000080">1- All sexually active women less than 25 years of age.
2- Men or women who have had a new sexual partner, or more than one partner, in
the preceding year. 3- Women of any age who use non-barrier contraceptive
methods. 4- Women with itchy vaginal discharge, abnormal vaginal bleeding, and
experience painful intercourse. 5- Men with itchy penis discharge. Other factors
associated with increased risk are: two or more sexual partners per year, drug
users -including alcohol-, low social and economical status, and gonorrhea in
the past year.</font></p>
<p><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">Manifestations of disease.</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#000080">After the contagion, the disease manifestations can
occur between 2 to 6 weeks, or be much more longer.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><i><b>A: In</b><strong>fection among women.</strong></i></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Most of the CI (60% to 80%) among women are without
symptoms. There are often CI associated with other STDs, especially<em>
gonorrhea:</em> an estimated 44% to 79% of women with gonorrhea also have an
infection with CT. The association of CT with <em>human papilloma virus</em>
(genital warts) is a predisposing factor for developing genital cancer. The <strong>symptoms
</strong>of CI depend on the affected region:</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font color="#000080">When the womb vaginal portion <em>-cervix-</em> is
    infected, there is purulent vaginal discharge, lower abdominal pain,
    inter-cycle or post-intercourse bleeding, and pain during or after
    intercourse.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Lower abdominal pain, acute or chronic, if the
    infection is located in the womb, or fallopian tube(s).</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">CT may produce <em>Pelvic Inflammatory disease</em>(PID)
    that is characterized by abdominal pain, shivering or shaking with
    high-grade fever, purulent vaginal discharge, womb tenderness, vomiting, and
    pelvic abscess. Women with acute PID should be hospitalized. The chronic
    form is characterized by pain with menstrual cycles, sore intercourse,
    infertility, recurrent low-grade fever, and tender mass in the lower
    abdominal region. PID has increased its incidence in the recent years due to
    the rise in STDs, and PID is most common in young and sexually active women
    with multiple partners.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">When the affected region is the <em>urethra </em>-
    canal conveying urine from the bladder to the exterior of the body - the
    symptoms are burning pain during urination and urinary frequency, often with
    turbid, foul-smelling or dark urine, and lower abdominal discomfort. This
    infection is named <em>urethritis.</em></font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Pain and tenderness in liver area when the infection
    is located in this region.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">CT may produce <strong>severe </strong>pelvic
    infection after an abortion.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font color="#000080">CI has been associated with long term <strong>complications</strong>:
chronic PID, infertility (64% of infected women), and pregnancy arising outside
of the womb (42% of infected women). In this last situation the fetus is not
viable.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3"><i>What about CI during pregnancy?</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">First of all, you need to know that CI may cause
recurrent abortion, this means, the loss of 3 or more pregnancies in succession.
CI is often asymptomatic in the mother. The prevalence of CT among pregnant
women is between 5% to 25%. Prenatal CI has been associated with premature
rupture of the layers surrounding the fetus in the womb, premature delivery, or
delivery of a dead child. The newborn can acquires CI through contact with the
maternal infected genital discharge at birth, and may develop an eye infection
in 18% to 50% of cases, and/or a lung infection in 11% to 20% of cases, both
during the first year.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><i><b>B: Infection among men.</b></i></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">It is estimated that 1% to 21% of all men with CI are
asymptomatic carriers of the infection, and may act as reservoirs that spread
the disease. Disease <strong>symptoms</strong> depend on the affected area, for
example:</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font color="#000080">Manifestations of <em>urethritis,</em> when the
    urethra is infected. (See above).</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">If CI is located in the bag that contain the
    testicles the symptoms are sudden pain and redness of the bag with marked
    swelling in the painful testicle, and a cord-like structure located in the
    bag. This cord-like structure is the tube for transit of sperm from
    testicles to penis.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Another affected region is the <em>prostate</em>
    -gland in males which surrounds the bladder- symptoms are pain in the lower
    abdominal and back areas, fever, and burning pain during urination.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><strong><font color="#000080"><i>C: Infection in males and females.</i></font></strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><font color="#000080">Eye infection.<strong> </strong>Males and females
    with genital CI can infect the eye(s) through finger contact, or by direct
    contact with genital discharge. This eye infection, or <em>conjunctivitis,</em>
    may become chronic and lead to formation of abnormal tissue on the eye and
    blindness. Conjunctivitis due to CT is the major cause of<strong> blindness</strong>
    worldwide. Manifestations of the eye infection are: eye redness, itching,
    tearing, and purulent discharge.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">In both sexes, CT is able to produce infection in
    the groin area, often bilateral, characterized by a large and inflamed lymph
    node, with the tendency to fuse, soften, and break down to form multiple
    draining channels, permitting the escape of pus, and leading to extensive
    scarring. Other symptoms in this particular situation are: fever, bone pain,
    arthritis, skin rashes, as well as, eye and brain infections. Inapparent
    infection and latent disease are common in promiscuous individuals.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">When CI is located in the anus region, or beyond, it
    produces anus-rectal pain, mucus-purulent or bloody discharge, pain with
    bowel movements, constipation or diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramping.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">Laboratory.</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Some laboratory tests are available to confirm if CT is
causing the infection. Your doctor will decide which is the most convenient.</font></p>
<p><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">What about CI treatment?</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The CI treatment is with antibiotics. <em>Tetracycline</em>
is the drug of choice among non-pregnant women and among men. In pregnant women
and patients for whom tetracycline is unable to be prescribed, <em>erythromycin</em>
or <em>amoxicillin </em>is recommended. The treatment length is 10 to 14 days.
The recent introduction of <em>azithromycin</em> has allowed a
single-effective-dose therapy in non-complicated cases.</font></p>
<p><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">Prevention.</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Only abstinence or a stable monogamous relationship
between two uninfected partners can assure the avoidance of CI and other STDs.
Barrier contraceptive devices, specifically<strong> latex</strong> condoms,
provide the best alternative to abstinence by preventing direct contact with
genital lesions or secretions; however,<u> the protection is</u> <u>not 100%.</u>
Answering these questions, will give you an idea about your STD risk:</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font color="#000080">Are you sexually active?</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">How many partners have you had during the past
    couple of years?</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Have your partners been men, women, or both?</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">What have you been doing to avoid STDs?</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font color="#000080"><strong>Some important tips to remember. </strong><em>&quot;To
prevent is better than to treat.&quot;</em></font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font color="#000080">CI is frequently without symptoms, and often
    associated with other STDs.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080"><strong>Women</strong> can get the <strong>worst </strong>CI
    <strong>complications:</strong> chronic pelvic pain, infertility, pregnancy
    outside of the womb, recurrent abortion, and ill or dead newborns.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Sexual partners must be screened, and treated to
    break down the infection link.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Take the treatment strictly as prescribed until
    finished, and avoid drinking alcohol while you are taking antibiotics.
    Return for follow-up visits as requested by your doctor or clinic.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">It is recommended to stop sexual activity until
    medication is finished.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">To prevent STDs, you have to use barrier methods of
    contraception, particularly <strong>latex </strong>condoms.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Be <strong>forewarned</strong> about the dangers of
    high-risk sexual partners.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#000080">If you want to know more about CI, if you are worried
about a STD, please feel free to call your doctor or Health Department. Your
health is important to us, we are working for you.</font></p>
