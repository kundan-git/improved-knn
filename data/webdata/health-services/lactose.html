<p align="center"></font><b><em><font size="6" color="#000080">L</font></em></b></font><b><em><font size="6" color="#000080">actose
Intolerance</font></em></b></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3"><em>Lactose </em>is a non-absorbable sugar,
named <em>disaccharide,</em> found as a common constituent in the milk, milk
sub-products, and others aliments such as infant formula, salad dressings,
soups, margarine, baked goods, cake and pancake mixes, syrups, candies, caramels
and luncheon meats.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3">Under normal conditions the dietary lactose is
dissolute, or hydrolyzed, in the second portion of small intestine by a specific
enzyme: <em>lactase. </em>Lactase hydrolyzes lactose into two <em>mono-saccharides:</em>
<em>glucose</em> and <em>galactose</em>, that are ready to be absorbed by the
intestine. The absence, total or partial, of the lactase enzyme causes lactose
intolerance and leads to diarrhea. This is a chronic diarrhea, and will be
present until the intolerance is diagnosed and treated. Lactose intolerance in
adults is common world-wide, and its incidence is 70-90% in Orientals, Native
Americans, Indians, Jewish, Mexicans, Blacks, Italians, and Greeks.<br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</font><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">Lactose intolerance can be:</font></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><font color="#000080" size="3"><strong>Congenital: </strong>very rare
    condition caused by the lack of lactase enzyme from the birth.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080" size="3"><strong>Primary: </strong>the most common
    form. It is due to an apparently normal decrease in the lactase activity,
    starting around 4 to 5 years of age. Though lactase is normally present in
    adequate quantities in infants, in some people the lactase concentration
    naturally decline, and is low in a large number of individuals by their
    teens or early 20's. The primary form is permanent.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080" size="3"><strong>Secondary: </strong>it results as
    an intestinal mucosal damage induced by some previous cause, for example: 1-
    After an acute illnesses such as viral or bacterial diarrhea. 2- People with
    giardiasis: infestation by <em>Giardia lamblia</em>, an intestinal parasite
    that produces chronic diarrhea. 3- Some inflammatory or ulcerative bowel's
    diseases. 4- After gastric surgeries. 5- Some drugs, especially antibiotics,
    and those used for the cancer treatment. The secondary form may be
    transient, depending on the previous cause.<br wp="br1">
    </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3">Also, there are two other types of sugar
intolerance:</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font color="#000080" size="3"><em>Fructose. </em>It is the common citrus
    fruit sugar, i.e. apples and pears.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080" size="3"><em>Sorbitol. </em>This sugar is used as a
    sweetener in &quot;sugar-free&quot; products, such as candies, diet pops,
    chewing gum, etc. Both, fructose and sorbitol, in susceptible people are
    capable of causing intolerance symptoms if taken in large amounts.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">What are lactose intolerance symptoms?</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3">When the available lactase enzyme is
insufficient to digest all the sugar lactose, the non-absorbed sugar remains in
the small intestine for an extended period of time, retains fluids and
intensifies intestinal movements, producing an abdominal <strong>bloating
feeling </strong>and <strong>cramps.</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3">The undigested lactose is decomposed by the
intestinal flora, producing excessive carbon dioxide and hydrogen gases. These
gases contributing to <strong>flatulence, </strong>meaning an excessive amount
of gas in the stomach or intestine, leading to distention of these organs, and
increasing the <strong>abdominal discomfort, </strong>or producing <strong>pain</strong>.
Some contributing osmolality changes produce the <strong>diarrhea.</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3">The symptoms appear after consumption of milk,
dairy products, or food containing lactase, even in some cases, after small
amounts.<br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</font><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">Diagnosis.</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3"><em>Do not </em>diagnose yourself. You have to
go to your doctor, or dietitian, because there are others intestinal diseases
with the same symptoms. The diagnosis, although often established clinically, is
confirmed by a lactose tolerance test: Breath hydrogen test. Lactose
intolerance, onset in adults, should be associated with <em>regional enteritis.</em>
This is a chronic diarrhea due to gluten intolerance: gluten is a protein
present in the wheat and other grains.</font></p>
<p><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">What about treatment?</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3">Removing the offending sugar from the diet
will often result in the problem remission. However, milk and milk products are
valuable foods, recognized as nutritionally complete and they form part of an
adequate balanced diet. Milk restriction may limit essential nutrients in the
diet, such as calcium, riboflavin, niacin, folacin, thiamin, protein, vitamins
A, D, and B<sub>12 </sub>, potassium, magnesium and zinc. Calcium and riboflavin
are of particular importance because milk and milk products are the primary
source of these nutrients. The restriction of milk and dairy products leads to
calcium deficiency in the body, and <strong>osteoporosis.</strong> In this last
case the bone loses its calcium producing bone pain, deformities, and fractures
easily.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3">In some cases the congenital lactose
intolerance form, may lead to a high calcium level in the blood and the
formation of kidney stones. The mechanism of this paradoxical situation is
unclear.</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font color="#000080" size="3">Milk from soy-protein, or soy-milk
    formulas, are excellent cow milk substitutes. The inconvenience is related
    with its taste.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080" size="3">Lactose reduced 2% milk is available in
    many grocery stores. This milk has 90% of lactose reduced and the
    nutritional value is the same as regular milk.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080" size="3">Lactase enzyme drops, available at a
    pharmacy, supply the missing lactase enzyme and do not alter the nutritional
    value. Fifteen drops will convert nearly all of lactose present in 1 liter
    of regular milk at refrigerator temperature (6<sup>o</sup>C) in 24 hours.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080" size="3">Lactase enzyme tablets, also available at a
    pharmacy, have to be taken just before eating a meal or food containing
    lactose, or before drinking regular milk. The requirements (5 to 15 drops,
    or 1 to 3 tablets) may vary between individuals, and the quantity to be
    eaten or drunken containing lactose. These enzymatic products are usually
    well tolerated, however, diabetic persons should take special precautions.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080" size="3">The new concept of <em>Probiotics </em>-living
    cultures of micro-organisms and contra-parts of antibiotics are used to (re)establish
    the intestinal flora by stimulating the host immune system of patients with
    lactose intolerance, however, until now, it is an expensive method.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">Lactose intolerance and milk allergy,
are they the same problem?</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="3">The answer is no. Milk allergy symptoms are:
skin rash, diarrhea and/or constipation, bronchitis, and blood in stool. This
particular allergy is due to an immune response to <strong>protein </strong>present
in the milk and milk products. Milk allergy is very rare among adults.<br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</font><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">Some useful tips.</font></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><font color="#000080" size="3">Drink smaller quantities of milk (1/4-1/2
    cup) at one time and spread it throughout the day.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080" size="3">Drink milk with meals or snacks; avoid
    drinking it on an empty stomach.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080" size="3">Whole milk is better tolerated than skim
    milk.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080" size="3">Try yogurt, especially without
    pasteurization, it seems to be helpful and well tolerated.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080" size="3">Cheeses such as cheddar, gouda, brick,
    blue, colby, edam, provolone, Swiss and mozzarella should be well tolerated.
    Try lactose reduced 2% milk.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080" size="3">Remember, milk and milk products are
    valuable and necessary in a balanced diet.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080" size="3">Calcium deficiency leads to intermittent
    muscular cramps and osteoporosis.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080" size="3">Try lactase enzyme drops (add the drops to
    regular milk 24 hours before drinking the milk); or, try lactase enzyme
    tablets just before eating milk products or food containing lactose, and
    enjoy them!!!.</font><font size="2"></li>
