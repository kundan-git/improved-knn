<p align="center"></font><em><font size="6" color="#000080"><b>Campus Health
Initiatives</b></font></em><font color="red" size="+3"></p>
</font>
<p align="center"><strong><font color="#000080">History of Campus Health
Promotion at UW</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In 1977 C.H.P. (Campus Health Promotion) was
established to promote the well-being of people on campus. This project was
involved in many educational activities, like weight loss and smoking cessation
programs and coronary risk screening. Lack of ongoing funding meant the end of
C.H.P. in 1984.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Then in 1995 the C.H.I.P. (Campus Health Initiatives
Project) was rolled out when co-op students, Tanja Hartmann and later Sharon
Duff, conducted a survey to figure out in what areas the campus community felt
they needed help to enhance their health. A report may be found in the resource
centre of Health Services.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The health survey was implemented in the fall of 1995,
and polled undergrad and grad students, faculty and staff. Undergraduate
students filled out a survey during a class; grads, faculty and staff were sent
surveys through the mail. The survey was basically a tool to determine where and
how people wanted to make lifestyle changes and in which areas people were
satisfied with their own activities. Knowing that people are interested in
eating in a more healthful way, for example, means that many promotion efforts
will be directed towards this, and other areas where people have shown a need.
This resource effective way of doing health promotion makes sense for today's
campus community.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><i>So what did the survey tell us about students,
faculty and staff?</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">First of all, 7.3% of and anticipated 10% of undergrad
students were surveyed. There was a very good response rate to the mailed
surveys, 16.8% of grad students and 22.6% of faculty and staff replied. In total
2605 surveys were completed.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">One of the survey's first questions asked people to
rate their own health. Almost 63% of all the respondents rated their own health
as excellent or very good but almost all would like to do at least one thing to
maintain or improve their health. Grad students reported having excellent or
very good health most often (of the three groups surveyed), with 72% of grads
falling in these categories.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Is the University of Waterloo healthy? Well, 62% of
respondents report eating healthier, and 58% say they are exercising regularly.
Another major area of focus was learning to cope better with worry or stress,
with 38% of people saying they were doing that. About 20% of undergrad and grad
students say they are drinking less alcohol, and 18% of undergrads report
practicing healthier sexual behaviour. Ten percent of people said they were
doing nothing to enhance health.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Do people use health enhancement services on campus?
For the proportion of people using and being aware of on campus cervices, the
department of Athletics and Recreational Services came out tops. Respondents
were most aware of department of Athletics and almost half of respondents say
that they are using services like the PAC and Campus Rec. Health Services and
Counseling Services look pretty good here too.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">People also use off campus health enhancement services.
More than a quarter of respondents use health clubs or are members of sports
teams off campus. Eight percent use some kind of alternative medicine found off
campus.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The survey asked what people would like to do in the
next year to enhance or maintain their health. The greatest number (79%) of
respondents say that exercising regularly is something they would like to start
or continue to do. Eating healthier, learning to cope with worry or stress and
losing weight were also behaviours that people wanted to start in the next year.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">So we know that most people consider themselves pretty
healthy, are engaging in healthy behaviours, but would to do more to keep
themselves healthy and fit. Most people feel they are stopped (69%) from making
lifestyle changes because they are too busy or have a lack of time.
Overwhelmingly, people felt that this was a barrier to making healthy changes in
their lives. Cost (20%), as well as residence or home life (15%) were reported
as being things that stop people from making changes to better health. People
felt that environments like &quot;with a buddy&quot; or &quot;individually&quot;
would be the best for health enhancement. Self-help reading material was
reported as being the best method to make lifestyle changes, as well as
workshops and articles in newspapers or newsletters. To make health enhancement
more accessible, respondents stated most often (55.1%) that they wanted UW to
provide more information on services that already exist.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><i>What about C.H.I. (Campus Health Initiatives)?</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">One of the main goals of C.H.I. is to provide a
starting point for people looking for health resources on campus. So what is a
health resource? Well, there are tons of them right here on campus, like the PAC
and BMH. Others like Counseling Services can help you out with stress or
procrastination, the Safety Office can teach you about lab safety and EAP is a
program to support UW employees. Believe it or not all of these things can
contribute to your overall health. So if you're wondering what the best brand of
Cornflakes is, we can't help you, but we will be able to point you towards where
health resources exist. Maybe you'd like to know more about preparing for exams
but don't know how to go about getting that information, C.H.I. could tell you
about counseling Services who provides a workshop on exam preparation. C.H.I. is
part of the Health Services web-site.</font></p>
