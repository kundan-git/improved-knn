<p align="center"></font><em><font size="6" color="#000080"><b>Flesh-Eating
Disease</b></font></em></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em>Necrotizing fasciitis, </em>better known as
Flesh-eating disease (F-ED), has gained great notoriety in the recent years.
F-ED could be lethal not only due its severity, but also, because of the
difficulty in diagnosis during its early stages. F-ED is a life-threatening,
invasive soft-tissue infection, and potentially fatal. Characterized by
widespread, faster destruction of the skin and under skin tissues, as well as,
the tissues that cover the muscles. It can affect both sexes at any age.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="4"><strong>What kind of germs produce F-ED?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">F-ED is produced by different bacteria; however, the
bacteria known as group A - Streptococci (GAS) is the leading F-ED producer. GAS
is a very aggressive and invasive germ, and it is able to produce another grave
disease: <em>Streptococcal toxic shock</em> <em>syndrome </em>(STSS). Note: a
syndrome is the union of signs and symptoms that characterize a disease in
particular. In Ontario, the F-ED rate is about 1.8% cases per 100,000 population
per year. About 15% of these cases are associated with STSS; however, despite
the absence of conclusive proof, this rate may be increasing. The F-ED <strong>mortality
</strong>rate is 30% or higher, and it is correlated with age and health status,
early diagnostic and treatment, as well as, development of complications in the
patient.</font></p>
<p><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">What body areas could F-ED affect?</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Anywhere. However, F-ED is common in the head and neck
areas, especially eyelids. In these cases, F-ED could have originated from
dental, eye, or throat infection; from surgical procedure, or from a
post-traumatic origin. Legs and arms are other body primary sites. In 70% of the
cases, the portal of entry is &quot;open&quot; skin.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">There is an uncommon form of F-ED: <em>Fourmier's
gangrene.</em> It is a deadly and rapidly progressive disease located in the bag
containing the testicles, and the penis area. It occurs as a result of local
trauma, or by extension from a penis infection, as well as, from an anal or
deep-anal infection. This particular F-ED is associated with a high mortality
rate. A high index of suspicion is essential for early recognition whenever a
person presents discomfort and swelling in the testicle bag.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="4"><strong>What causes the</strong> <strong>disease?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">There are different opinions among scientists. Some of
them believe that F-ED may be caused by a new aggressive factor transferred into
strains of GAS; other evidence suggests that F-ED and STSS are caused by a new
GAS clone. Up-dated studies done by a research group, show that, a <strong>toxin</strong>
released by GAS may be the cause. It acts as a super-protein capable of
stimulating the body's immune system causing a massive response, that leads to
the body's destruction instead of combating the intrusive bacteria.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="4"><b>Who is at highest risk for F-ED?</b></font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font color="#000080">Elderly individuals</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Those with a chronic disease, systemic or local, for
    example: AIDS, cancer, heart disease, diabetes, lung disease, etc.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Alcohol and/or drug users</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Individuals with chickenpox</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Close contact another F-ED case</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Certain predisposing conditions such as traumas, and
    post-surgical procedures. F-ED is rare in children, but the aggressive
    cancer treatments could be a high risk factor for them.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font color="#000080">However, cases of F-ED have developed in <strong>healthy
</strong>people.</font></p>
<p><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">What are F-ED symptoms?</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#000080">F-ED and STSS are classically associated. Some people
have initially only non-specific symptoms such as pain, vomiting and diarrhea.
After this, within 48 to 72 hours or less, the disease becomes worse and, on the
affected area of the body, appears severe local pain with systemic high-grade
fever and the person feels very ill. Then, there are skin changes on the painful
area: redness, swelling, large blisters and tissues destruction. The systemic
blood pressure comes down, and the patient may develop kidney and liver
failures, with external and internal bleeding, severe difficulty in breathing,
and redness on all skin surfaces.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Several laboratory procedures<strong> </strong>can help
doctors in early diagnosis: blood tests, X-rays, aspiration of suspicious
lesions, biopsy and culture, magnetic resonance imaging, etc.</font></p>
<p><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">What about treatment?</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The key to successful treatment is <strong>early </strong>diagnosis
combined with aggressively cutting off the destroyed tissue, and administration
of antibiotics in high doses; oxygen at high pressure is also used. Recently, a
blood component named plasma from people who had severe F-ED, has been used with
success in the treatment of other people developing F-ED or STSS.</font></p>
<p><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">Preventing F-ED.</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Health Services recommends personal cleaning care,
changing underwear every day; washing your hands carefully before eating, and
after using the washroom; early medical care of open skin lesions, or eye
infections, especially in elderly people.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Children with chickenpox have to avoid the drug named <em>ibuprofen
</em>(learn this name!!).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">It is recommended to get <strong>&quot;preventive
medication&quot;</strong> if you have had contact with a person developing F-ED.
This preventive treatment is an antibiotic oral for 10 days and you <strong>must
</strong>get it without delay to avoid disease transmission.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Actually, a potential vaccine for F-ED has been
successfully tested in mice.</font></p>
<p><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">Who are candidates for preventive
treatment?</font></strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><font color="#000080">All contacts living in the same household as the ill
    person.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">People who had close contact with the ill person,
    for example classmates.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">People in close contact with patients who have F-ED
    or STSS.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">All close contact with persons whose death is due to
    GAS infection.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">Remember.</font></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><font color="#000080">Flesh-eating disease is extremely infectious,
    contagious, with high mortality.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Discomfort and swelling in the testicles bag: be
    highly suspicious about F-ED.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">If you had contact with someone developing F-ED, you
    have to see your doctor immediately.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">If you have to get preventive medication, you must
    use it for the full 10 days.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Maintain good hygiene habits all the time.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#000080">If you have a questions or need to know more about F-ED
or STSS, feel free to call your doctor, nurse, or Health Department.</font></p>
