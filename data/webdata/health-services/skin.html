<p align="center"></font><em><font size="6" color="#000080"><b>Skin Cancer</b></font></em></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Sun exposure is the only major causative factor for
skin cancer for which prevention is feasible.</font></p>
<p><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">Classification.</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><b>A.&nbsp; N</b><strong>on-melanoma cancer:</strong></font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font color="#000080">Basal cell carcinoma.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Squamous cell carcinoma.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Bowen's disease.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080">Paget's disease.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font color="#000080">Both, basal and squamous cell carcinomas are most
common in areas <em>sun-exposed: </em>head, neck, hands and forearms.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><strong>B.&nbsp; Malignant melanoma: </strong>Is the
least common form of sun-induced skin cancer, however, it is <strong>the most
serious </strong>because of its high mortality rate, and also the danger to send
<u>early invasion</u> anywhere into the body. Melanoma is common in <em>sun-burned
</em>areas: ears and back in men, lower legs and back in women.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><strong>Statistical survey.</strong> The incidence of
skin cancer has doubled with the reports indicating that the depletion of the
ozone layer is worsening. It is estimated that 92,000 new cases of melanoma and
2,750,000 new cases of non-melanomas occur world wide each year. In Canada, it
is estimated there will be over 60,000 new cases of non-melanomas and 3,000 new
cases of melanoma this year. The incidence of skin cancer is 29% higher in white
males than in white females, and melanoma has been increasing in white
populations by 3% to 7% per year over the past 30 years. Malignant melanoma is
the 3rd cause of death after lung and breast cancers, and it has only <strong>one
effective</strong> form of <strong>treatment: </strong><u>early surgery.</u> The
melanoma vaccine is still under study.<br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</font><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">How does sun exposure produce skin
cancer?</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The sunlight contains three types of ultraviolet (UV)
rays: <em>UVA, UVB</em> and <em>UVC.</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><strong>UVA</strong> and <strong>UVB</strong> rays are
responsible for the skin damages due to: 1-Direct damage on all the skin
structures. 2-Mutations of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), resulting in an
altered cell function, or cell death. 3-Immuno-suppressive effects on the skin.
An example of the last case is the frequency of cold sore (Herpes simplex)
following intense sun exposure. UVA and UVB are both, tumor initiators, and
tumor promoters or carcinogenic. The temperature and weather conditions do not
affect the intensity of UV radiation, however, UV levels are reduced if there is
a thick cloud cover. The sand, water, concrete and snow reflect the UV rays and
increases the amount of UV that reaches the skin.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><strong><font size="4">Risk factors.</font></strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The probability of developing sunrelated skin cancer is
not the same for each individual:</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font color="#000080"><strong>Genetic factors</strong>. There are several
    phenotypic and genotypic factors of significance in predicting skin cancer
    development. People with the highest risk factors are those with: eye color,
    blue or grey; hair color, blond or red; complexion, fair-complexion; tend to
    freckle and skin's photo-types I and II.</font></li>
  <p><strong><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Which is your skin's photo-type ?</font></strong></p>
  <p><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  I ------------------------------- Always burn, never tan.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; II
  ------------------------------- Usually burn, light tan.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; III
  ------------------------------- Sometimes burn, always tan.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IV
  ------------------------------- Never burn, always tan.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; V
  ------------------------------- Brown.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VI
  ------------------------------- Black.</font></p>
  <li><font color="#000080"><strong>Significant risk factors.</strong> There are
    factors that raise the risk of developing skin cancers, such as a changing
    mole, increased age, family/personal history of melanoma, large numbers of
    moles -more than 50 in an adult-, ethnicity: European-high risk,
    Hispanic-low, Asian and African-very low. Other significant risk factors
    are: chronic cumulative sun exposure, as well as exposure to
    &quot;sun-tanning&quot; lamps or beds, outdoor work, poor immunologic
    system, pre-malignant lesions such as <em>warts, </em>especially those
    located under the nails, and <em>solar keratoses</em>. These lesions are
    located on the face, more often on the forehead, and appear as result of the
    chronic skin sun damage. The solar keratoses have round shape, are flesh
    colored and feel like little patches of sandpaper. Another risk factor is
    the presence of some chemicals in the environment, for example arsenic and
    polychlorinated biphenols (PCBs). To date, no significant trend has been
    reported between the use of oral contraceptives and risk of malignant
    melanoma.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080"><strong>Dietary factors.</strong> A low-fat diet
    reduces the occurrence of skin cancer. Experimental studies have suggested
    that dietary antioxidants, such as the vitamins E, A, C, and the
    beta-carotene, may inhibit the growth of melanoma, and that alcohol intake
    promotes its growth.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">What about skin cancer and AIDS?</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The association between skin cancer and AIDS is well
known. Skin cancer seems to grow more rapidly and be more invasive in patients
with AIDS. Both, the sunlight exposure, and human papillomavirus infection
(genitals warts), have been associated with the development of skin cancer in
HIV-infected patients.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><strong>Photo-protection. </strong>Skin cancer is <strong>preventable</strong>
with the adoption of good <strong>photo-protection habits</strong> from <u>early
childhood,</u> and the modifications of sun-seeking behaviour among adults. The
photo-protection should <strong>start in infancy,</strong> however, it is never
too late. The keys for good photo-protection are :</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font color="#000080"><strong>Common sense.</strong> Recognition of the
    risk of sun damage. <strong>Avoid </strong>the midday sun exposure period:
    between <strong>11 </strong>a.m. and <strong>4 </strong>p.m. the UV rays
    reach theirs highest UV levels, especially from early April to late October.
    Adopt shade-seeking habits: umbrellas, trees, canopies, etc. Do not rely on
    the temperature as a guide. <u>Avoid</u> the tanning salons, remember that
    UVA rays are carcinogenic, as well as responsible for early skin aging.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080"><strong>Clothing.</strong> Must be of a densely
    woven fabric in order to block light transmission. The color, thickness and
    type of fabric are less important factors. Wide-brimmed hat, long-sleeve
    shirt, long pants, and sun glasses with UV protection are recommended.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000080"><strong>Sunscreen.</strong> Sunscreen provides good
    UVB protection, which is the most active in contributing to the production
    of skin cancer; also, sunscreen blocks out as much as 50% to 75% of UVA
    light. It is very important to protect all sun-exposed areas: face, neck,
    ears, hands, etc., by using a sunscreen with <strong>sun protection factor</strong>
    (<strong>SPF</strong>) of <strong>15 </strong>or higher containing Parsol
    1789, Titanium dioxide or Zinc oxide. Also it is recommended to use a lip
    balm with SPF of 15 for lip protection.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font color="#000080" size="4"><strong>Some sunscreen precaution</strong>.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Do not forget that <u>sunscreen does not provide
absolute protection.</u> For very fair persons, who burn in five minutes at
midday, even an SPF of 45 will<strong> protect</strong> for about <strong>two
hours </strong>only<strong>,</strong> not the whole day.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Sunscreens are not effective immediately and they must
be <strong>applied</strong> <strong>30 minutes</strong> <strong>before</strong>
sun exposure, and<strong> reapplied</strong> every two hours, after swimming or
high perspiration. Waterproof sunscreen can vary from one product to another,
you have to read the labels carefully.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><strong>Self screening.</strong> Early detection is the
key to successful treatment. The mortality due to melanoma is clearly related to
the depth of the invasion of the tumor when removed. Melanomas vary from spots
to nodules (like a mole) with colors from flesh tints to black, and frequently a
mixture of white, blue, purple and red. The border tends to be irregular and
growth may be rapid. When a former or recent mole <strong>changes</strong> its
color, size, borders, surface, that means &quot;red alert&quot; and you must go
to your doctor. Sometimes the first manifestation of malignancy is a itching
mole. <strong>Take my advice:</strong> If you notice something suspicious on
your skin, go to the physician immediately.</font></p>
