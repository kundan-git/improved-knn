<STRONG>RIVER SIGNALS RELEASED!</STRONG> This small book by William McGinnis and the Whitewater Voyages staff presents a comprehensive language of hand and whistle signals which can be useful in all sorts of situations, including coordinating groups of boats, coping with emergencies, and making those all-important emotional connections—both on the river and at cocktail parties! Intuitive and easy to remember, these signals enhance cooperation and good will within and between boating groups, and make river journeys safer, smoother and more fun. Call us to order a copy.<BR>
<BR>
The publication of <STRONG>River Signals</STRONG>, which, like Bill's other books, will be sold iin bookstores and outdoor shops worldwide, is the latest in an ongoing series of contributions by Whitewater Voyages to the growth and development of the ever-evolving sport of whitewater rafting.<BR>

<BR>
We are proud of Whitewater Voyages' leadership role in the world of river rafting. A few examples, in case you were not aware: We pioneered guided trips on many of California's finest rivers. As a Whitewater Voyages guide in the early '80's, Jim Cassady invented the modern self-bailing raft. And Bill's books <STRONG>Whitewater Rafting</STRONG>, <STRONG>The Guides Guide</STRONG>, and the <STRONG>Class V Briefing</STRONG> have helped foster not only safer but also warmer, more caring guiding on rivers throughout the world.
