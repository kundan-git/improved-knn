<P>Make a sea cruise part of your travels when you visit Newfoundland and 
Labrador. Then you'll know why they say half the fun is getting there. Marine 
Atlantic's modern car ferries also accommodate recreational vehicles all year 
round from North Sydney, Nova Scotia to Port aux Basques in southwestern 
Newfoundland. Throughout the summer, a second ferry sails from North Sydney to 
Argentia, bringing you to within an hour or two of St. John's. Marine Atlantic 
ferries offer a wide variety of onboard accommodations and features, including 
deluxe cabins, dormitory sleepers, full meal and beverage service, live 
entertainment, movies, and children's activity programs.<BR><BR>A variety of 
ferries and coastal boats operating on year-round and seasonal schedules can 
take you to island and remote coastal communities. There's a twice weekly 
service from Lewisporte, Newfoundland, that takes you and your car to Happy 
Valley-Goose Bay, Labrador. Smaller communities on the Labrador Coast are served 
by a passenger and freight (no cars) vessel that sails from St. Anthony to Nain 
and back, giving passengers an opportunity to visit remote coastal villages and 
experience life on a coastal freighter. There's another vessel that takes you to 
that little bit of France called St. Pierre! Whenever you're on the water, be 
prepared to be entertained and amazed by wonderful natural spectacles. Like 
humpback and minke whales that appear in season, or the many varieties of 
seabirds that roost in huge coastal colonies. Ferries are floating observation 
platforms. Along the eastern coastline, look for icebergs bigger than you ever 
imagined. Those who live by the sea swear that the best way to see Newfoundland 
and Labrador is from the water. Come see for yourself.<BR><BR><B>FERRY 
SERVICE</B><BR><BR><U>Nova Scotia to Newfoundland</U><BR><BR>Year-round vehicle 
and passenger ferry service is provided by Marine Atlantic between North Sydney, 
Nova Scotia, and Port aux Basques, Newfoundland. Crossing time is 6 hours. (This 
ferry connects with the trans-island bus service operated by DRL Coach 
Lines.)<BR><BR>From mid-June to mid-September, an additional ferry operate

kilometres from Route 1 and 131 kilometres from the provincial capital of St. 
John's. Crossing time is 12-14 hours.<BR><BR>For rates and schedules,
