<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Looking for employment is
one of the most challenging jobs you will ever have. Finding
&quot;your&quot;
job rather than &quot;a&quot; job is important, as work plays a big role
in contributing to the sense of satisfaction in your life. As you begin
to look for your next position, think about how it fits into your overall
career plan. Is it work that will give you the experience you need to
begin
or continue your progression toward your longer-term career goals? Is it
work you will enjoy doing? Feel passionate about?</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>The longer you are inactive
and postpone job search activities, the harder it will be to start.
&quot;A
body in motion tends to stay in motion.&quot; Fear of failure can also
lead to procrastination.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Unfortunately, many job
seekers
have an unrealistic picture of how much time job search takes. <b>It is
never too early to begin making contacts. </B>Start in the Fall term for
a summer job. For co-op, internship, contract or on-going (permanent)
positions,
monitor the job market year-round so that your research is up-to-date.
If you are still in school, or working full-time but wanting to change
jobs, plan to spend up to 8 hours each week. After graduation, or if you
are currently unemployed, your search should become full-time. An example:
if unemployed or not in school, 8 hours sleeping, 8 hours job search
activities,
and 8 hours exercising, socializing, doing chores, and volunteering. If
you have been searching for several weeks or months, an employer will want
to know how you have been spending your time. Have activities with a
practical
application to the job market to talk about. For technical people whose
knowledge may become outdated quickly, be able to show how you are staying
current in your field.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Review your worksheets from
steps 1, 2 and 3 at the beginning of the Manual so that you can direct
your job search efforts. Know what is important to you, know what you
enjoy
or do not enjoy doing, know what skills you have to offer, and know what
type of work is a good fit for you. In short, only <u>you</U> know what
kind of work you want and what you are best qualified for. Without a
focus,
you will not be able to prepare excellent resumes and letters, or sell
your strengths in interviews. Be able to discuss your accomplishments.
Employers today want to know why you selected them and what you are
prepared
to do for them. Also, think about your life beyond this work you are
looking
for. Where are you heading in the future? Now is the time to form the
foundation
for those 20+ jobs and 7+ careers you likely have ahead of you. What
skills
will you need to develop or update?</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Working Overseas</B><font size=+0>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>You are living in a Global
Village. As you are thinking about the type of work you want to do,
consider
if, or how, you would like to be connected to the international community.
There are several ways: living in Canada and being in contact with people
in other countries through correspondence, telephone or e-mail; living
in Canada and travelling on behalf of your employer to other countries;
living and working in another country. </FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Employers who hire for
international
assignments will look at your qualifications from two perspectives: (1)
the specific knowledge and skills required to do the work well (e.g.,
experience
in managing projects, proficiency in the language of the country, computer
programming) and (2) your ability to excel in a cross-cultural setting
(e.g., sensitivity, flexibility, self-discipline).</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Following are some points
that you will need to consider:</FONT></FONT></P>

</TABLE>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">Devising a Plan to Find
Employment</FONT></B></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Develop a plan. Your job
search should not be random activities. Map out your strategy in advance.
If not, you could find yourself back at your starting point with little
accomplished for the time you have spent. Set daily and weekly objectives
so that you will have a concrete way to evaluate your progress. Determine
the amount of time you will allocate for: <b>identifying target
organizations,
researching, making contacts and following up</B>. Set your priorities.
Schedule at least one activity away from home each day to get yourself
out into the community and energized. Be sure to document every step. This
will save you time, keep you organized and prevent embarrassing errors.
Consider that you may be in contact with 15 organizations in the span of
one week. You don't want to make a costly mistake. Imagine showing up for
a meeting at the right time but at the wrong place! An example of a <a href="employercontact.html" webstripperlinkwas="employercontact.html">record-keeping
form</A> is included at the end of the Employment Contacts section.
Prepare
business cards. They are an effective, fairly inexpensive method of
leaving
information with anyone who has the potential to lead you to job openings.
A summary card with the equivalent of a 30-second commercial about your
strengths can fill a need where a business card may be too brief and a
resume may be too lengthy.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Organizing Support</B><font size=+0>
</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>You will need support while
undertaking your job search. First, you will need financial support. If
you do not have much in the way of savings, you may want to consider
part-time
work. Try to look for something with a flexible schedule. This will allow
you to attend interviews at times suggested by employers. Some jobs (e.g.,
sales) give you an added opportunity to speak with many people from
diverse
employment backgrounds. Jobs through a temporary employment agency may
be an alternative. You may need to take an interim job until the position
you would like becomes available. This type of job also allows you to
broaden
your qualifications and develop contacts in the areas of your interests.
</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Second, moral support is
very important. &quot;No&quot; will reach your ears more often than
&quot;Yes&quot;.
To minimize the number of &quot;no’s&quot;, ask as many open-ended
questions
as possible to find out information and get advice. It may still become
difficult to avoid feelings of rejection, discouragement and lack of
self-worth.
For each &quot;no&quot;, analyze the circumstances. Are the factors
outside
of or within your control? Work diligently on those you can control and
let the others go. Also, try to surround yourself with people who are most
likely to boost your confidence. Volunteer—an organization will appreciate
your help. The people there will become aware of your enthusiasm and the
quality of your work. Another benefit will come if you have the
opportunity
to work and interact with other volunteers. They may be able to give you
some information and advice about your job search
activities.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Celebrate your achievements
every day. Examples of successes could be: finalizing the arrangements
to meet a contact; completing 10 telephone call-backs by lunch-time;
getting
company information that was difficult to locate; speaking with a hiring
manager briefly in person. Reward yourself with a pleasurable activity.
Take some time out each week to participate in social or recreational
activities,
or hobbies. You need the break to renew your level of
energy.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">Imagining Success</FONT></B></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Visualize the work you would
like to have. Create mental pictures of yourself accepting the new job
and working in an interesting and stimulating position. If you cannot
imagine
what it will be like, it will be hard for you to achieve it. An active
imagination can help you overcome obstacles in your way.</FONT></FONT></P>

those who charge fees to the applicant to ensure you would be getting

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">EMPLOYMENT ADS IN NEWSPAPERS AND
PROFESSIONAL</FONT>
PAPERS/MAGAZINES</B></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Remember that the employer
is advertising for the ideal candidate. If you don't think that you have
ALL the requirements but feel that you can do the job ... APPLY! You may
be the most qualified person for the job. However, be realistic. If you
don’t measure up on a critical qualification, e.g., being bondable, you’ll
waste their time and yours. Do not disregard a job because of the job
title.
Read all the ads because some are alphabetically listed according to the
first letter of the first word which may not be the job title. Look at
and analyze the job description. The text will also be a strong indicator
as to the nature of the position. Words such as &quot;self starter,
challenging&quot;
will denote requirements for a different kind of person than words such
as &quot;reliable, conscientious&quot;. Check the jobs advertised in the
Career section of the newspaper in addition to those in the Classified
section. Watch also for companies that have several advertisements listed.
You may have found a company in hiring mode with additional jobs not yet
advertised.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">INTERNET SITES WITH JOB ADVERTISEMENTS
AND RESUME MATCHING SERVICES</FONT></B></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Both profit and non-profit
organizations are using the Internet to hire because of the low cost
compared
to newspaper advertising. Through an Employment or Career Opportunities
section on the organization’s own web pages, the information is available
7 days/week, 24 hours/day until someone is hired. The company can broaden
their search to include individuals worldwide and make it easy for
candidates
to apply through a direct e-mail connection. Changes to the advertisements
can be made quickly whenever necessary. Some companies are including bonus
information such as how to get ready for and submit an application, as
well as how to prepare for a job interview.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>In addition to job fairs
where employers meet candidates in person, virtual job fairs are becoming
popular with employers. A fair can be organized by a company on its own
behalf, or by a company for several organizations.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Check out also the large
multi-purpose sites and bookmark your favourites. They offer any
combination
of: job listings, resume databases, discussion groups, career planning
information, industry updates, and links to other sites of interest. Since
job titles in electronic advertisements (as in non-electronic ads) may
not reflect the job content, look at a wide variety of positions. As you
are reading through the job descriptions, pay special attention to the
most important qualifications mentioned, including the up-to-date ones.
These are the key words you will need to include in your resume. If you
don’t have those qualifications, you will probably need to get them to
be competitive.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Some newspapers also provide
web pages where they include jobs which were advertised in their
newspapers.
Some recruitment firms also have web pages listing jobs they received from
their clients. Many companies have set up a business matching jobs
received
from employers with resumes received from people looking for
positions.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>In fact, there are so many
databases where you can submit your resume that you will need to do some
careful screening in order to get the level of service you want. Some
companies
will charge you to put your resume on file. However, it is usually
preferable
to have the employer pay rather than you. When a position is received,
the computer sorts through your resume information. Because the computer
uses key words to search for candidates, you will need to have the
appropriate
qualifications presented in an easily identifiable format. (More
information
on preparing an electronic version of your resume is in the Resume Writing
section of the Manual.) If there is a match, your resume and/or a summary
of your information is forwarded to the employer. Choose your level of
confidentiality. Some companies do not permit employers to examine their
database. The search is conducted by their own staff. Therefore, if you
are currently employed or decide that your resume should not go to a
particular
employer, the company is able to control where resumes are sent. With
other
companies, you are given a code number so that your personal
identification
is omitted, and provided only after you give your
consent.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>To maximize your time and
money using the Internet for job search, here are some points for thought.
</FONT></FONT></P>

<dir>
<dir>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Which companies should you
list your resume with? (Develop a list of criteria important to you and
check out the policies of the firms.) Do they receive jobs in the field
you are interested in? How many jobs that would fit your qualifications
do they typically receive? How large is the database and what type of job
seekers are represented in the greatest numbers? Do they charge job
applicants?
How often can job seekers update their files? What information is given
to an employer: the actual resume, paper or electronic copy, a summary,
etc.? How would you know if your resume has been forwarded to an employer?
How long is an applicant kept on the database?</FONT></FONT></P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>After applying to electronic
jobs, if possible, follow up with a phone call to speak personally with
the hiring manager and the Human Resources person processing applications.
State your interest and inquire about the hiring process, timelines,
etc.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>At this point, you may have
one of two responses: (1) I don’t want to want to go on-line or (2) The
Internet is the answer to getting my job. For those of you having the
first
reaction, you could hire an expert to do your work for you. However, at
some point you will need to learn how to search job banks, send your
resume
electronically, research employers, network, and keep up-to-date in your
field. Now may be the best time to become proficient. Although you may
find work by using the Internet exclusively, the effectiveness of this
method varies according to the type of work being sought. Don’t use it
as your only job search tool. To help you get started, view Career
Services

<center><p><a name="creative"></A><b><font size=+2>Creative Methods of
Marketing Yourself</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>There are several phases
before an advertisement appears for a job. The hidden job market refers
to points (1) through (3).</FONT></FONT></P>

<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>(1) Work needs to be done,
but no one has recognized the fact.<br>
(2) People realize their need but nothing has been done to find
someone.<br>
(3) An outline of requirements is written and people are informally
looking
for candidates.<br>
(4) No qualified candidate was located so job description is given to
Human
Resources to advertise.</FONT></FONT></P>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">It is a generally acknowledged fact that
between 80% - 90% of all jobs available at a given time are not
advertised.
Chances are very high that you will locate your work INDEPENDENTLY.
Accordingly,
you should spend 4/5th of your job search time on creative pursuits. Read
articles about companies reporting their business plans, expansions,
changes,
new additions. Consider small to medium sized employers as more jobs are
being created in these sectors. You need to target your application to
the person who would hire for the position. Remember, managers are always
looking for good people even if there is no immediate opening.</FONT></P>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">APPLYING TO HIRING
MANAGERS</FONT></B></P>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>IN
PERSON</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>This is probably the most
effective method, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to meet with
people who hire because of their increased workloads and the numbers of
job seekers who are wanting to speak with them. However, do your research,
prepare your resume, and go. If you are in the area anyway, you may find
it productive to walk in and ask if the head of the department you would
like to work in could speak with you. It's more difficult to dismiss a
person than another piece of paper. The Personnel or Human Resources
Office
only learns of upcoming positions once managers have exhausted their own
private sources. Even if you are not able to speak with the manager, there
may be someone else available to fill you in on additional background to
help you in your application.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>THROUGH A TELEPHONE
CALL</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>If distance does not permit
an initial personal visit, telephone to make preliminary inquiries and/or
to arrange a meeting at a mutually convenient time. When you have the
hiring
manager on the phone, be ready to make a strong first impression. State
your name first and then how you found out about him/her, (e.g., name of
person who referred you). Present your 30- to 60-second commercial about
what you can contribute to the department. Ask for a meeting to be able
to provide more details. You may wish to suggest a date and time and ask
if that would be convenient. Be as flexible as possible around the
employer’s
busy schedule. If the person doesn’t want to meet with you, ask if you
could phone again in 2 to 3 weeks to inquire about opportunities.
</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">BY BROADCAST
LETTER/RESUME</FONT></B></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>For maximum effectiveness,
follow up the mailing with a phone call and visit. Remember to address
your letter to A PARTICULAR PERSON who is THE HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT YOU
WANT TO WORK IN, not to a title like &quot;Marketing Manager&quot;. If
you are not able to get the person’s name through alumni or your
networking
contacts, phone the company in question. You may also be able to obtain
the information through a resource such as employer directories. However,
you will want to phone to ensure that the person listed in the directory
is still manager of the department.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>In your letter, mention how
you found out about the position and include the name of the person who
referred you, if you were given permission to do so. Tailor your
qualifications
to the employer’s needs. To bring your qualifications back into the
employer’s
mind, you are able to write again when you have updated your resume, so
that the latest one can be on file. With so many resumes being received
by employers, yours needs to attract their attention and be readable in
15 seconds or less! The focus is on what you can contribute. A poor
response
rate can often be attributed to what appears to be a lack of self
direction.
Include your career objective and relate your abilities, skills and
experience
to that specific area within the organization.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>With more employers using
computer applicant tracking systems to help with the workload of screening
both solicited and unsolicited resumes, it can be to your advantage to
target as large a number of employers as you can prepare applications
tailored
to those employer’s needs, using appropriate terminology. The cost to you
is minimal and at least you are in their database if they are looking for
a person with your qualifications. However, do not depend solely on this
method of job search to produce job interviews for you. Most people still
get their work through personal contact.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>More information on writing
broadcast letters and resumes can be found in the Resume and Letter
Writing

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">JOB CREATION</FONT></B></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Have you identified a
problem
that you feel able to solve? You may wish to prepare an outline of a
proposal
and send it to the employer. If interested, the employer could request
the full proposal and arrange a meeting with you to discuss it. Impressed
with your qualifications and the benefits you could offer, many companies
would be glad to create a position for someone who could save them time

when and where you want, i.e., to be in control of your life? Are you
being
realistic? Money may come in later, probably not in the beginning. Your
customers’ needs will actually determine what decisions you make and to
a great extent, the location and hours of service. </FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>(3) <b>Business Acumen:</B>
Do you have what it takes to run a business if you do not have a partner
or associates helping with some of the aspects? If you lack expertise in
one or more areas, outsourcing may be a solution. Areas include:
financing,
merchandise/services, pricing, sales, customer credit, advertising and
promotion, employees, facilities, equipment and supplies, purchasing,
operating
procedures, insurance, record keeping, tax and legal issues, government
regulations.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>(4) <b>Experience:</B> Since
there is such a high failure rate for new businesses, you will want to
reduce the risks as much as possible. You will need to identify business
opportunities relating to your skills. Are you able to analyze consumer
needs and marketplace trends in order to decide upon which products and
services are needed and which you have the capability to provide? Do you
want to focus on (1) producing goods and services; (2) selling or buying
and reselling goods and services produced; or (3) providing investments
for the production and selling of goods and services (e.g. venture
capital)?
Test the market. Is there a demonstrated need? What code of business
ethics
will you adopt (e.g., maximizing profits while fulfilling social
responsibility
regarding environmental pollution)? Presenting a professional image will
help you gain the confidence of your clients. Your customers will make
value judgements based on personal interactions with you, as well as upon
your telephone service, stationery and business cards. You will need to
find your niche, and provide a high level of customer service.
</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">Business/Marketing Plans</FONT></B></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Decide upon a business name
and register it if necessary. Write a business plan and update it
regularly
to determine if you are meeting your goals. Good guides for writing a plan
are available. How will people hear about you in order to check out your
products or services? Complete a marketing plan so that you can get the
best value for advertising dollars. Practice so that you will be able to
(1) describe your business in 20 seconds or less, and (2) end with a
strong
close to encourage a sale. Study what impact, if any, international trade
will have on your business. Develop a vision for 2-3 years into the future
so that goal setting will be easier. Modifications to the plan can be made
when necessary. Will you be successful alone, or do you need one or more
other people to join with you as you work toward a common goal? Whatever
you choose to do, you will need to have a passion for the work to get you
through the rough times. Being able to laugh and have fun will make your
work much more pleasurable.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">Financing</FONT></B></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>With a little capital, it
is possible to start a small business. You could begin on a part-time
basis
while employed elsewhere. There have been interest-free loans available
through provincial government sources for both summer and on-going
(permanent)
jobs. Check to see what programs are currently being sponsored. Perhaps
you could finance the start-up and operating costs with your own savings,
or with a loan from a friend or relative. What will the initial financial
repercussions be on your family? What will you have to give up?

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">Homepreneurs and
Telecommuters</FONT></B></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Decide if the work you want
to do could be done from your home. It is a more economical way to begin.
However, by working at home, you will have your work there 24 hours a day
and 7 days a week. Will you be able to establish some balance in your
life?
What percentage of time would you like to set aside for personal,
recreational,
educational and other activities? Telecommuting is becoming a way of life
for many people through their own choice, or by companies wanting to
reduce
the number of employees working at their business location. For the
telecommuters,
there are similar pluses and minuses as experienced by homepreneurs. You
will also need to work out an arrangement with your employer regarding
your projects, reporting method, hours available, performance evaluation,

<center><p><a name="networking"></A><b><font size=+2>Networking:&nbsp;Developing
Leads And Making Contacts</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Networking is making
connections
with individuals and groups of people, and can be accomplished by personal
meetings, through the telephone or fax, on paper, or via the Internet.
This section will help you whether you are looking for a job as an
employee
of a company or organization, or whether you are looking for work as an
independent contractor or freelancer. Networking contacts can help you
locate job opportunities in both the visible and hidden job markets.
</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>It is estimated that 65-90%
of jobs are found through networking. An informal survey among your
employed
friends would reveal that many, if not most, found employment this way.
You can't begin networking, however, until you have defined the type of
work you want. Interviews to help you decide on potential careers are
called
information interviews and should not be confused with networking
interviews.
Getting the two straight in your mind may be difficult. If you have
reviewed
both of these principles and are still a little unsure, please speak to
someone in Career Services.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Networking can bring many
benefits to the job seeker. Individuals who find employment in this manner
tend to be more satisfied in their job and earn a higher income. Steering
away from the advertised market has other advantages too since it often
over represents lowly paid/unskilled or highly paid/highly skilled
positions.
Most people find work somewhere in between these two extremes. Secondly,
the advertised market can be deceiving since many jobs there are
non-existent
or already filled (by avid networkers) before being printed. Lastly, the
qualifications listed in such ads can be significantly higher than the
requirements of the job before being advertised.</FONT></FONT></P>

Reluctance to Liaise</FONT></B></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Networking means making many
contacts. It is nothing more complicated than that. Some of you may find
the idea of networking, initiating contacts, and speaking with strangers
a daunting task. You do not need to put yourself in the difficult position
of asking everyone for a job. What you would like to accomplish instead
is the establishing and maintaining of relationships which are mutually
beneficial, with you helping others achieve their goals as they help you
achieve yours. Be a good listener and reflect on the information you get.
Have a genuine reason to speak with a person, since having to generate
&quot;small talk&quot; may add to your discomfort. Then when chatting with
strangers about their interests and yours, your enthusiasm will help you
conquer your nervousness. Volunteering is one way to develop relationships
and have people get to know you and your talents. You may need to work
on your body language, including your voice and eye contact, in order to
project capability and confidence. Deal with the aspects of networking
that you dislike the most by analyzing what they are and coming up with
an action plan to overcome them. When is your energy the highest? Are you
a morning person? That is the time to undertake the tasks that require
the most energy from you. Always build time into your schedule to relax
and become refreshed by doing whatever activity you enjoy.
</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Sometimes it is necessary
to do what you must, even though it’s the last thing you want to do, e.g.,
make a phone call to arrange a meeting. Most people are nervous when
tackling
something new or are unsure about the outcome. Yes, there is an element
of risk. But when you are successful, e.g., the meeting is arranged, your
self-confidence grows. With repetition, your skill level increases too.
In time you’ll come to believe that you can handle whatever needs to be
done. You have expanded your comfort zone!</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><a name="Knowing"></A><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Knowing Someone
on the Inside</B><font size=+0> </FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Managers trust people they
know more than people they don't. From the employer's viewpoint, it makes
sense to hire a &quot;known quantity&quot;, someone who has been
recommended
by a person who is known and trusted. Employers also reduce their
recruiting
costs in this way. Employers like to have referrals from their own
employees.
People who hear about the job from insiders eliminate themselves if they
feel the job would be a poor fit or if they don’t have the skills. The
applicant’s resume therefore seems to be more tailored to the
qualifications
of the job. The person appears neither under- nor over-qualified for the
position. The timing is better. Therefore, if you know someone inside a
company you would like to apply to, it may be possible for you to get
information
on what to include in your resume and when to submit it. Contacts inside
the organization can also keep your name in people’s minds. With e-mail,
it is easy to stay in touch.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><a name="Network"></A><b><font face="Times New Roman">Establishing a
Network</FONT></B></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>The great thing about
networking
is that you already have a network in place. Consider all of the people
you know personally (e.g., uncle), or come in contact with regularly
(e.g.,
dentist), or briefly (e.g., person next to you in supermarket checkout
line). The following list may help you to get started:</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Consider the names you have
just written. Do these contacts have a) hiring authority (could hire you
for the work you want), b) job leads (have knowledge of the industry in
general, ideas on how to approach people, skills required) or c) ability
to refer you to others (may not know field but have many contacts in
general)?
Label the names with a, b or c. Don't worry if you don't have very many
a's on your list. Most people don't. Your b's and c's will refer you to
the a's. Put a &quot;*&quot; beside the names that are in or may have
knowledge
of the geographical area in which you prefer to work. Your approach is
very important. If the people you are contacting do not have hiring
authority,
don't scare them off by asking them for a job. They still have valuable
information to share, including names of other contacts in the industry
who may have such authority.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Practice! Practice!
Practice!
<b>First, begin with a small group of people you know well.</B> Ask those
willing to help you to critique your approach. Networking is not just
handing
out your business card and requesting assistance. Networking is
reciprocal.
It’s learning about others and how you can be of service to them.
Networking
is being friendly in a genuine way. Listening is the key to effective
networking.
If you spend most of your time asking questions about your contacts and
building good rapport, they will eventually turn the conversation around
to you. Then you can let people know what you need, and perhaps even what
particular goal you want to accomplish. Explain what it means to you. Pose
open-ended questions. &quot;Who do you know who..&quot; is better than
&quot;Do you know anyone who&quot; which can be answered with yes or no.
Example: &quot;I just read that ABC Co. is planning an expansion into
Southport
City to begin a new line of widgets. In a recent project, I did some
research
on &quot;x&quot; and accomplished &quot;y&quot; in my last job. I would
be very interested in contributing to the start-up of their new line and
getting it competitively launched. Who do you know who may know someone
currently working at ABC Company?&quot; You can present your skills and
abilities assertively, without being loud or pushy.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0><b>Second, compile a list
of people you know who have jobs in the field you are interested in.</B>
Contact each person and suggest that you meet for coffee (or something
equally as brief). Up front, let them know that you are not looking for
a job with them or from them. You are seeking their expert advice. When
you meet, again, don’t ask for a job. You may want to ask for
recommendations
on what they would do if they were you, where they see opportunities in
the field, who could advise you about potential areas, and with whom you
could speak about what might be coming up in the future. Try to get an
introduction to the next person you could talk with. Perhaps you could
get 2-3 referrals from a contact you know quite well and has no hesitation
in referring you. From others, listen carefully while they speak. If they
talk about a company or organization that seems promising, ask if they
have suggestions as to whom you could speak with. Then phone your new
leads.
Tell them where you got their names (only when you have permission from
your contact to do so). Ask for 15 minutes of their time. Suggest meeting
for coffee near their office. However, they may prefer to have you go to
their office. Your agenda, as before, is to learn about the other person.
By finding out about your networking contacts’ interests, you can be of
service to them. If you see an article or hear about something that might
interest them, you can pass it along, and in the process renew your
association.
If you give leads, you will get leads, even though they may not come from
the same people you have given them to. If you manage your network well,
you will know who can benefit from your business and personal contacts.
Hopefully you will be remembered when something does come up in your line
of work. Through the particular information you receive on organizations,
work specifics, and candidates’ qualifications, you will be in an
excellent
position to speak with hiring managers. You will have a competitive
advantage
when you present the contribution you can make. With a good
&quot;fit&quot;
and your enthusiasm for the work, the managers will be more interested
in speaking with you.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0><b>Third, talk to the heads
of departments or organizations where you want to work.</B> Begin with
organizations low on your priority list to gain experience. It can be
quite
difficult to get to the person who hires because of the people who screen
calls (e.g., secretary, receptionist, assistant). It is important to work
with them. Fully identify yourself immediately, as gatekeepers are
generally
skeptical of people appearing to hide something. If you are asked, let
them know why the manager would benefit speaking with you. Be sincere.
Be confident and assertive, but treat everyone with respect. Build
rapport.
Don’t appear to be schmoozing. Ask for the name of the people screening
so that you can use it on subsequent calls when they answer the phone.
Ask questions. Show that you want to learn about their needs. The more
information you have, the better off you will be when you speak with the
manager. You may also want to try phoning early in the morning, over the
lunch hour, later in the day, when the manager may be answering his/her
own phone.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>When you try to reach a
hiring
manager and are transferred to someone else within the organization, use
the opportunity to develop another contact. Don't know what to say?

REQUEST: Stress that you are seeking job information and not a job from

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>When you do meet with the

<p><a name="OperatingEfficiently"></A><b><font face="Times New" roman"><font size=+0>Operating
Efficiently and Effectively</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Create a work schedule:
research
to do, phone calls to make, letters to write, and meetings to attend. If
you can, prepare your list of the next day’s activities the night before.
When you get up in the morning, you are then able to begin work right
away.
Keep records of people you are trying to, and did, reach. P=phoned. L=sent
letter. E=sent e-mail message. V=left voice mail message. F=sent fax.
M=arranged
meeting. C=completed follow-up. Add the date on which each activity
happened.
Keep all your information about your networking contacts in the small
notebook
or diary you began when conducting your information interviews. When you
are speaking with anyone, note what their interests are, what they want,
and how you can be of service. Add to your diary their name, address,
phone,
fax, e-mail, plus any other relevant information you have learned about
them or from them. By having the details readily available, you may be
able to help someone. Carry the diary with you all the time. You will
always
know the status of each contact, and can follow up even when you are not
at your desk. When you need to leave a voice mail message, in under 30
seconds give complete information about who you are and why you called.
Make sure the greeting on your answering machine is business-like. If you
are not sure about the reliability of others taking a phone message for
you, you may want to consider adding a second phone line with a
professional
answering service. If the type of work you are looking for means that
employers
need to get in touch with you quickly when you are away from your phone,
consider wearing a beeper so that you can return calls very
promptly.</FONT></FONT></P>



<p><a name="Telephone"></A><b><font face="Times New Roman">Telephone
Strategies</FONT></B></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>In addition to speaking with
people in person, the telephone can be an efficient way for you to collect
information from people who can make suggestions on what jobs are or will
be available in the hidden job market and the hiring qualifications.
Initially
you may find using the telephone intimidating, with the result that the
person you are speaking with senses your lack of confidence. Preparation
is the key. The words you say (the script) will need to be well thought
out. Your voice needs some practice to warm up before you begin
conversation.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>So much of the meaning of
your message is communicated by the way you speak over the phone, rather
than by the actual words you use. Tape-record yourself giving a 3 to 5
minute presentation. Do you have a pleasing tone? Are you talking at the
right speed for the listener? Are all the words clearly and easily heard?
Do you put emphasis on words or ideas that are more important to catch
the listener’s attention? Did you notice some habits that will cause the
listener to become distracted? Do you have a liberal sprinkling of verbal
fillers such as ummm, ahhh, like, you know, etc.? Are you using the
fillers
to give you time to think? Instead, be silent while you think. Do you
raise
your voice at the end of the sentence even though you are not asking a
question? Although the listener cannot see your body language, you need
to be just as careful as though you were meeting face-to-face. Sitting
in a business-like manner will help you maintain professionalism. Smiling
will help you to become more relaxed and project a more positive attitude.
Show enthusiasm and be polite. </FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Based on your research,
prepare
a list of potential contacts and prioritize them. Begin making your phone
calls to those names at the bottom of the list so that you will be
experienced
and confident when you get to those most important to you. After you
select
the person to phone, prepare a written list of questions that you plan
to ask. Make sure though that you don’t ask for information that you could
have located through a publicly available source such as a directory or
web page. Speak initially with people who are currently working with a
potential employer, not the hiring manager, but people in that department
(or in other areas) so that you can get helpful details to tailor your
application to the employer’s needs. </FONT></FONT></P>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>When you get the person on
the phone, identify yourself and mention how you found out about the
organization.
Since you will need some of their time to answer questions, ask if they
have a moment now or if they would prefer you to call later. Don’t mention
that you are looking for a job. They can too easily brush you off with,
&quot;There’s nothing available.&quot; You first need to find out if there
is a fit between you and the organization. Ask open-ended questions about
non-confidential or non-proprietary information and terminology. If it
is appropriate, you could request the name and title of the person who
hires. Ensure that you get the right spelling. If you don’t know whether
it is a male or female name, ask. Since you are inquiring about the field
of work generally and that company specifically, you may also ask if there
is anyone else you should speak to about finding other opportunities in
the area you want to work in.</FONT></FONT></P>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>You will need to keep good
records of the information received and names of other people mentioned,
as well as any terminology/vocabulary used to describe the work. Add the
date of your phone call and what follow up you need to do. If you need
to get back to a person again, begin your conversation by jogging the
person’s
memory of what you talked about the last time. </FONT></FONT></P>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>If you get a voice mail
recording
when trying to reach a contact, know what you want to say. If you are
unprepared,
hang up and call again later. The message needs to interest them in
wanting
to speak with you. If you want them to call you back, let them know the
best time to reach you. Repeat your phone number again at the end so that
they do not have to go back through your message to find it. However, you
may be wasting your time waiting for the phone to ring. It may be
preferable
for you to say that you will get back to the person. Then keep trying
until
you do.</FONT></FONT></P>
<p><a name="Geographical"></A><b><font face="Times New Roman">Geographical
Considerations</FONT></B></P>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Looking for a job in a
geographical
location where you currently do not reside is a major task. Begin by
subscribing
to a local newspaper and checking out the area on the Internet. Job
hunting
is best done in the location you want to work in. However, you may find
it more economically feasible to make some phone contacts before
travelling
to your preferred location. If the time zone is different from yours, be
sure to call at a favourable time to them. A long-distance calling plan
may help you to reduce the costs of many long distance charges. For
contacts,
try alumni or business associations in the area. Set your dates for a trip
there. Write and telephone to arrange meetings. Finish the rest of your
job search in that location. The hiring manager may be more willing to
meet with you as the company would not have to pay your travel expenses.
When there is a job opening, employers are more inclined to interview
&quot;local&quot;
people who meet their qualifications. It would be helpful for you
therefore
to have an address and phone number from the location you wish to move
to, so that you can include it on your business card, in your resumes and
letters, etc. Perhaps you know someone in the area who would give you
permission
to use his/her address and phone number, as well as pass along messages
to you. You may want to consider getting a 1-800 number or inviting people
to call you collect. It may be in your best interests not to relocate
permanently
to another community until you’re sure of employment.</FONT></FONT></P>
<p><a name="Internet"></A><b><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Using
the Internet</FONT></FONT></B></P>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>The Internet is a great
source
of information on the job market and on specific companies and
organizations.
Investigate relevant employment news and discussion groups. Members are
very supportive of each other and most are willing to help answer
questions.
Honour the rules established by the group. Don’t just lurk—participate!
With hundreds or thousands of readers, you have an easy way to network.
If you look only at advertised positions on the Internet, you will miss
the vast majority of openings.</FONT></FONT></P>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Asking for help on the
Internet
can result in assistance or annoyed feedback, depending on how you phrase
your request. If you are not sure how to use the many resources, ask a
professional to explain. As with in-person or telephone conversations,
don’t ask for information you could find on your own through printed or
other sources. Ask the right person the right question. If you want help
from a discussion group on the Internet, look for their Archives or FAQ
(frequently asked questions) section first because your answer may be
there.
When submitting a question, write in complete sentences with good grammar
and no words that people from other cultures may not understand. Mention
that their assistance or suggestions would be appreciated. Offer to
compile
the replies you receive and pass them back to the group. Etiquette
dictates
that you should ask people to help you find information rather than give
you the information. Make sure your name and e-mail address are available
at the bottom for people to get back to you. Thank each person who replies
to you.</FONT></FONT></P>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Job searching is the same
online as off. Be professional in your writing, in contacting employers
through e-mail, and in following up on contacts you make as well as
requests
made by employers. If you wish to terminate contact with an employer
because
you are no longer interested in that job or organization, send another
e-mail, thanking the employer for any consideration given to you, and
declining
further interviews (or whatever stage you are at). Keep their goodwill:
you may want to initiate contact again in the future.</FONT></FONT></P>
<p><a name="NetworkingMyths"></A><b><font face="Times New" roman">Networking
Myths </FONT></B></P>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>(1) MYTH: Do not network
where there is an advertised position. Send a resume. REALITY: You must
take additional action to set yourself apart from the other candidates.
Visit or phone to assist your application.</FONT></FONT></P>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>(2) MYTH: Approach
networking
strictly as a job search tool. REALITY: People who cannot hire you also
have valuable information to share. Keep up your contacts after your job
search too. Keep on good terms for future. Try to help your contacts where
possible. Networking is a two-way street!</FONT></FONT></P>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>(3) MYTH: Join many
associations
and hand out as many resumes as you can at meetings. REALITY: Do join one
or two associations that you really have an interest in. Then, participate
in meetings and take on assignments. Show the other members what you can
do, that you have the skills you indicate on your resume. Once these
people
see your skills, they will be more likely to want to recommend
you.</FONT></FONT></P>
<p><a name="Follow-up"></A><b><font face="Times New" roman">Follow-up</FONT></B></P>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Remember that follow-up is
critical. When you are given a referral, be sure you follow up promptly.
Otherwise you will disappoint two people, the person who gave the name
and the person who is waiting for your call. Thank-you letters are very
important. Take the opportunity to thank everyone who helped you. People
who gave you contact names and people that you got more in-depth
information
from should both receive letters. In your letter, be brief and sincere.
You may handwrite the note if you feel that you now know the person fairly
well. If you have received some good tips on changing your resume, do
mention
in your letter that you will forward your revised resume soon (try to
include
at least one of their suggestions).</FONT></FONT></P>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Upon accepting a job
(yippee!)
contact those in your network who assisted you and/or are referring you
to others. They need to know to stop searching on your behalf.
